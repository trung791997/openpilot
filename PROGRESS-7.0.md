# StarPilot 7.0 progress log

The progress log for `night-star7-longradar`, the default branch since 2026-10-24.

The old `STATUS.md` and `DECISIONS.md` on `iq-nav-on-pr10` / `ns-bosch-radar-testing` are **retired history**:
- STATUS entries 1–265 live there.
- D-numbers are still cited from there.

Do not add 7.0 work to them. Add new entries here, at the top of **Log**, newest first.

**Evidence words.** Every claim says *static*, *replay* or *limited road evidence*. Nothing below is road-validated unless an entry says so.

## Where things stand (2026-10-24)

| Change | longradar | V-ASM (`night-star7-vasm-jetson`) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Civic brake-onset relief back in (smaller gaps accepted for smoother brakes) | 093fd404d | a553e4157 | replay |
| Force Stop: a red light seen late brakes steadily | 7f9bdb4e7 | 6701db95f | replay + static tests |
| Force Stop: a gas tap keeps Force Stop out for its full 10 s | 2e869b83d | e384f2b12 | static tests |
| Civic stop-and-go: fewer brake on/off cycles, no gas surge after release (`CivicBrakeEdge`) | 7c8e5eee1, 71f3cc035 | 5b7c73e20, 2af60a652 | replay (route 1f) + static tests |

**The comma** runs V-ASM at 4f46c0a86, which predates the stop-and-go fix. It will be updated when it is parked.

## Open items

- **Stop-and-go fix.** Judge it on Peter's next stop-and-go drive: brake toggles per minute, short holds, gas surge after release.
- **D-048 radar-lead corroboration is shelved.**
  - The unshipped code is on branch `d048-corroboration` at a0d0bf865.
  - The reason is in the D-048 addendum and STATUS 264 on `iq-nav-on-pr10` (5ae8485d3).
  - Ideas not yet tried:
    - the radar point's lateral position against the model's lane lines;
    - driver overrides as a label, over many more hours.
- **Route 20 T285–287.** The hard slowdown looks like the radar locked onto the wrong object (STATUS 263). This is still ambiguous on the stills.
- **D-097 is not on this branch** (the gentle gas ramp after a coast, 6d9579ce5). `CivicBrakeEdge` covers the release-surge part on the Civic.

## Log

### 1 — 2026-10-24 — Stop-and-go brake cycling on the Civic (carried over from STATUS 265)

**Problem.** In stop-and-go traffic the Civic kept switching the brake on and off. Each time the brake let go, the gas jumped.

**Cause.** The brake request turned on at -0.12 and off at -0.02, measured on gas force plus road load. That band is so narrow that it limit-cycled on route 1f. On release, the gas was allowed to rise straight to the lookup value.

**Change.** `CivicBrakeEdge` in `opendbc_repo/opendbc/car/honda/bosch_longitudinal.py`. It is Civic only and default ON.
- The brake request turns on at -0.20.
- Once on, the brake holds for at least 1.5 s. It can escape early if the force goes above +0.2.
- After release, gas starts at 35 and ramps to the lookup value over 1 s.

**Replay results** (Job's harness, real class, route 1f, base → fix):

| Measure | Base | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Brake toggles per minute | 3.69 | 3.17 |
| Brake holds shorter than 1.5 s | 27.6 % | 16.7 % |
| Gas at release | 60 | 35 |
| Mean gas over the 1 s after release | 121 | 81 |

The first commit message (5b7c73e20) claimed 2.11 toggles/min and 0 % short holds. Those numbers came from a simplified simulation that left out the long-control-off resets and the escape. The figures above replace them.

**Not verified:** the change has not been driven.
