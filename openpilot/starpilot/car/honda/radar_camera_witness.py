"""Bosch-A camera witness: one rule that moves a published radar lead toward the camera (model) lead.

Three tells each give a target weight per lead index; the largest one passes one veto, one weight slew and one blend
(last section). dRel is never moved and the point is always published (D-041/D-042). Replaces radar_lead_bound
(WeakLeadBound), radar_reversal_bound (ReversalBound) and radar_camera_cap (CameraCap); their evidence is kept below,
one block per tell, in the words of its owner. The unification (shared veto, slew, order against CameraSlowBound) is
static; not replayed yet: every replay number below was measured on the separate modules.

=== Tell `weak`: unconfirmed and contradicted, or passed (was radar_lead_bound) ===
Two far false brake taps behind a lead that was not slowing (2026-10-26 drive), each with its own tell:

Route 34 (11c8fa231c0499ed/00000034--010fbd6343) T479, 16 m/s: radar track 55 swept in from 88 m to 52 m in 3 s
(range falling 15-17 m/s around the tap) while its vRel read -8 to -10.6, and became lead0 through the strict gate at
62-76 m with aLeadK already at the -3 clamp; the plan went to -1.91. The model lead held 61-66 m at 13-14 m/s with
a ~ 0, and its own range fell only 1-2 m/s. The track's F0 STATUS nibble read 9 (not confirmed) until +1.48 s.

STATUS 9 alone is not a tell: Job's census over the post-rebase routes found it on 8 % of engaged lead0 time and under
39 of 747 brakes, and on his stills 3 of the 14 STATUS-9 brakes on routes 0c-368 were real (2ed T338.6 a truck,
368 T657.1 stopped traffic, 0c T342.7) and 2 more lean real. A STATUS-only weight would have softened all five. What
route 34 has and they don't is the camera's range contradicting the radar's closing: from 0 to +0.7 s, over the last
1.5 s, the model lead's range fell 8.8-9.9 m/s slower than the radar lead's vRel said and slower than the track's own
range fell, while the model lead's range slope stayed within 3 m/s of its own closing speed. In 2ed T338.6 the camera
saw the truck late and the gap peaked at 5.8 m/s; in the other four it stayed under 1, and in the four real far
brakes (2f T736, 10 T188, 32 T1248, 0f T2190) at 0 even with STATUS taken as 9. A model lead whose range slope and
closing speed disagree by more than CAMERA_SELF_TOL (it jumped to another car: 25.6 m/s in 368 T657.1) is no witness.

Route 37 (00000037--34e868f7ba) T903, 30 m/s: an SUV 45-50 m ahead moving out to the right. Radar track 32 (STATUS 7,
old) dipped vLead 28.7 -> 24.8 (aLeadK -2.9) and went back to 31; the model lead held v 29, a 0 and moved on to the
next car at 61-71 m. Track 32 kept lead0 only through the relaxed gate: from +0.03 s, the start of the tap (plan
-0.29 -> -1.84), its range was more than the strict window (0.25 x range, at least 5 m) short of the model lead's.

That range gap alone is not a tell. On the same drive (T273-278) a pickup slowing to turn left held lead0 at 82 m
while the model lead had moved on to 110 m: the gap reached the window's edge and the plan went to -2.21 for a
real slowdown. There the model lead was itself closing at 11.7 m/s. In the four real far brakes it closed at 4.5 m/s
or more (median 9-13) and the gap stayed under 0.65 of the window; at route 37 T903 it closed at -0.2 to +1.5 m/s. So
the gap counts only while the model lead is past the radar lead and calls for no braking (camera_passed_ratio). On
route 37 none of the six real slowdowns on the stills then gets any weight at its brake; T323, an SUV turning right at
an intersection (ambiguous on the stills), gets at most 0.27 around its -1.12 (log emulation, not a replay).

So while a published radar lead is unconfirmed and its closing contradicted as above, its vLead/vLeadK/vRel and
aLeadK are moved all the way to the model lead's, and while the model lead has moved on past it, 0.6 of the way
(all the way once it is 1.5 windows past: b1 seg14, see DISTANCE_FAR_START), by
the shared blend (see "Shared veto, slew and blend" below; before the unification it was the curve-brake bound's blend,
radar_reversal_bound.ReversalBound.apply, floor_weights): only toward the less severe side, only with the
model lead as a credible witness, never when the radar lead is urgent, dRel never moved, the point always published
(D-041/D-042). Neither tell reads the radar lead's dynamics alone: the mismatch, cut-out and onset rules (PROGRESS-7.0
entry 8) did, and also fired on real slowdowns.

The weight is per lead index and rate limited so that a tell coming and going does not step the published lead
(D-042): a new radar track takes its tell's weight at once, an established one rises over RISE_S and releases over
RELEASE_S. (That slew is now the shared one, applied to every tell.)

Job's open-loop replay of the logged radarTracks through the full radard and the 7.0 planner (rebuilt replay; its
base under-brakes the logged taps by 0.09/0.12): route 34's tap -1.82 -> -0.19 (the brake never starts; 0.6 gave
-0.75), route 37's -1.73 -> -0.64 (1.0 on the camera-passed tell gave -0.60 at more cost on the ambiguous route 37
T323, so it stays 0.6; the far ramp from 1.25 leaves T323 alone and took b1 seg14's -1.07 to +0.11, every other
event within 0.15, 2026-11-08). The 19 real brakes (the four far ones, ev19, route 37's six slowdowns and T323, three
turn-offs) keep their minimum within 0.04 and their onset. Replay evidence only, open loop; no road evidence yet.

=== Tell `reversal`: accel reversal latch (was radar_reversal_bound) ===
Route 30 (11c8fa231c0499ed/00000030--70508f00bd) T1420-1425, a two-lane S-curve with guardrails both sides and the
lead 4-6 m off-centre: radar track 60 kept its ID while its range swung 45 -> 54 -> 39 m and vLead 22 -> 27.6 -> 15.7
in about 4 s. The model lead held 47-52 m at 21-22 m/s with a ~ 0, and on the stills the lead does not close.
Published aLeadK went +4.0 to -3.0 (the clamp) in 1 s; the negative half took the plan (lead0) to aTarget -2.87.

A real car does not go from accelerating above +2 m/s^2 to braking below -2 m/s^2 inside 1.5 s. Under that rule the
model lead had 0 hits on 18 radar routes (0d-20, 25, 27, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2e, 2f, 30, 31, 32), while radar leads had 18.
Only route 30's hit had lead0 braking the plan below -1.0 in the next 4 s. Of the 58 engaged lead0 brakes below
-1.5 on those routes, none had a same-track reversal in the 4 s before it (log level, limited road evidence; one
positive event, on one road).

So for LATCH_S after such a reversal the published lead's vLead/vLeadK/vRel and aLeadK are moved W of the way
toward the model lead, only when the model lead is the less severe, and only while the model lead is a credible
witness. dRel is never moved and the point is always published (D-041/D-042). The radar's own geometry bypasses the
bound when it is urgent (range or TTC short), so a real close-in brake keeps full authority. A false trigger costs
nothing unless the radar lead is braking the plan inside the latch.
Estimated effect on route 30 (regression on that route's lead0 rows, not a planner replay): -2.87 -> about -1.3.

A lead is blended once, at the largest weight among the tells (see below), under the same witness and urgency rules.
The latch itself is unchanged by the unification; its weight W now rises over RISE_S on an established track instead of
stepping in and out (static; not replayed yet).

=== Tell `cap`: far lead closing faster than a confident camera lead (was radar_camera_cap) ===
Far phantom brakes left after the weak-lead and reversal bounds (2026-11-08, Bob, replay at 93b5b5c9d7, Peter's stills):
  000000b0 seg17 ~17:05-17:13: radar track 53 at 60-80 m read vRel well below the model lead, which held its range
    (range slope within CAMERA_SELF_TOL of its own closing speed, a > -0.5). Phantom on the stills. The radar's own
    range slope agreed with its doppler at onset (-4.4..-5.4 vs -4.9), so no radar-only tell separates it: the
    contradiction bound (the weak tell above) needs STATUS 9 and the camera-passed tell needs the camera past the radar.
  0000008a seg2 and 00000071 seg12: the same shape; Peter: no car cutting in, phantoms.
Gating on where the camera lead sits against the radar's (at or past it, or no more than 5 m past) was tried in
replay and dropped: route 71 (gap/dRel 0.15-0.32) and b0 17:13 (up to 0.17) overlap, and either gate lost one of them.

So while a radar lead is at least CAP_MIN_D away, a camera lead with filtered prob >= CAP_PROB sits within
CAP_RANGE_FRAC of its range, its range slope matches its own closing speed within CAMERA_SELF_TOL, it slows no harder
than CAMERA_DECEL_MIN, and it closes more than CAP_GAP_MIN slower than the radar's vRel, the published vLead/vLeadK/vRel
are raised to the camera's closing speed. Only ever less braking, toward a camera that calls for none; never past the
camera. While the cap is active, aLeadK is also lifted toward the camera lead's a (floored at CAMERA_DECEL_MIN), never
lowered. dRel and the point are untouched (D-041/D-042). As a tell this is weight 1.0 (the full blend) when the
conditions above hold, and 0 otherwise. The weight slew (RISE_S / RELEASE_S, shared) replaced the separate dv rate
CAP_DV_RATE (8 m/s per second) and da rate CAP_DA_RATE (10 m/s^2 per second) the replay below ran at: the replay
numbers quoted are with the OLD rates and are the evidence quoted; the new slew, and the new urgency veto on this tell
(a lead under URGENT_D or inside URGENT_TTC is never moved), are static; not replayed yet. Before the unification this ran after
CameraSlowBound; CameraSlowBound (which only ever makes a lead slower) now runs after the witness.

Replay (open loop, logged radarTracks through radard and the planner, 3b3d + StockBrakeFeel + HumanFollowing, plan
min accel, before -> after): b0 17:13 -1.38 -> -0.59, 8a seg2 -1.81 -> -0.82, 71 seg12 -1.74 -> -1.35; 84 seg7 t0
(a queue at a signal 60-100 m out, leans real on the stills) -1.31 -> -1.13; 82 seg13 -0.91 -> -0.85, 99 seg15
-0.68 -> -0.62, 80 seg10 -0.53 -> -0.45; 80 seg19 -2.15 -> -2.27. The other groups of the 93b pool are unchanged, and
replay fidelity moved by at most 0.004 in correlation. Route a2 (60 segs): seg22 -1.34 -> -1.21, seg23 -0.96 -> -0.90,
seg43 -0.59 -> -0.39, seg45 -0.85 -> -0.64, seg50 -0.69 -> -0.74; a3 unchanged.
The cost case is 80 seg19: track 25 is a real slowdown the camera read late (vRel -8 against a camera calling for
much less), so the cap softened the first pulse (-1.70 -> -1.22, logged -1.80) and the second came 0.12 harder.
aLeadK lift (variant A, same replay, cap alone -> cap + lift): 71 seg12 -1.35 -> -0.93, 8a seg2 -0.82 -> -0.72,
b0 17:05 -0.59 -> -0.11; b0 t51.6 stays -3.40 (track 53's range-fit vRel, not the camera's case). No row anywhere
braked harder than the cap alone except 80 seg19's second pulse (+0.20); full-route fidelity moved <= 0.006.
Replay evidence only; no road evidence yet.

Mode (C-012): VA (above, default) or D+E (`hold=True`, the BoschACameraCapHold toggle, latched at construction). D+E adds a
limited, tapered hold: the gap floor is dropped, and while the cap tell was applied last cycle and the gap is at or below
CAP_GAP_MIN but above CAP_GAP_HOLD, the cap tell is (gap - CAP_GAP_HOLD) / (CAP_GAP_MIN - CAP_GAP_HOLD) (as a weight on the
gap; the old D+E target was gap * (gap - CAP_GAP_HOLD) / (CAP_GAP_MIN - CAP_GAP_HOLD) in m/s), for at most CAP_HOLD_T
seconds in total per engagement (hold_t is reset on a new track and whenever the cap tell returns to 0, deliberately not
when the gap re-crosses CAP_GAP_MIN).

=== Shared veto, slew and blend (static; not replayed yet) ===
One veto for every tell: the target is 0 unless the lead is present, radar, has a track id, its filtered model lead prob
is at least WITNESS_PROB, and the lead is not urgent (urgent(): range under URGENT_D or TTC under URGENT_TTC, the TTC
using radar.urgency_v_rel when the parser has no direct reading; b1 seg14 47.7 s). The urgency veto on the cap tell is new.
One slew: a new track id on an index takes its target at once; otherwise weight = min(max(target, previous - release),
previous + rise), rise = SLEW_W * dt / RISE_S, release = SLEW_W * dt / RELEASE_S. A veto drops the weight to 0 at once.
One blend: vLead/vLeadK/vRel move weight * (camera speed - vLead) and aLeadK weight * (model a - aLeadK), each only toward
the less severe side. `weights` is the applied weight per lead index (0 when the blend changed nothing); `tell_weights`
holds each tell's weight after the veto, before the slew, for replay/debug.
