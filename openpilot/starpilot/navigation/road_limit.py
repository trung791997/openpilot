"""Mapbox posted speed limit for the road being driven, without a destination.

Upstream StarPilot reads Mapbox's maxspeed only from an active route. This add-on
asks Mapbox Map Matching for the last few GPS points' road while no destination is
set, and publishes that limit through the same starpilotNavigation fields
(speedLimit, controlValid) that guidance uses. SLC still treats it as the online
fallback: used only when both chosen slots have no limit.

Turned off in Galaxy (Navigation > Route preferences), or with no Mapbox key,
nothing is requested and the limit comes only from an active route, as upstream.
