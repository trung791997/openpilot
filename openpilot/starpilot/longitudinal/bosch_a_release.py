"""Bosch-A release shaper: release coast (no gas off a departing radar lead), then the brake release limit and dwell; plus the short plan read-ahead.

Gates (owner 2026-11-13, no toggle): coast needs the radar on (bosch_a_toggles.long_tuning_active); smooth and action_t run on any
verified Bosch-A Honda with openpilot longitudinal, radar on or vision-only (bosch_a_toggles.vehicle_supported).

Section 1, release coast:

Bosch-A release coast: a lift instead of gas when a radar lead that was braking in our lane leaves it.

Owner bookmark, route 9e (replay evidence), 2026-11-07: following a car slowing to turn right, radar track 39 is
in our lane at 21 m, closing at 7 m/s, and openpilot is braking. As the car turns off, the radar lead is released at
-5.16 s (it is 1.24 m off centre). leadOne then becomes a camera lead 84-96 m away, the planner's accel target jumps
from braking to about +0.5, and the car asks for gas while the turning car is still partly in front of us. "I'd
rather it lift instead of adding gas" (owner, route 9e, 2026-11-07).

The earlier design kept a 1.8 m lateral path box around the departing track instead of reading the radar handover
directly. Census (2026-11-07) found it also re-kept a box truck in the next lane at -3.0 and cars riding the path
bend through ordinary turns, so it is not used here: the release coast only withholds gas off a release it can see
directly in radarState, and it never adds braking of its own.

Trigger (checked every planner cycle, previous leadOne vs current leadOne): the previous cycle's leadOne was a
present, radar-matched lead (radarTrackId >= 0) closing faster than RELEASE_VREL_MAX inside RELEASE_D_MAX, and in the
current cycle either leadOne is gone (not present) or it is a different track that jumped more than RELEASE_JUMP_M
farther away. For HOLD_S after that, the output accel is capped at 0 - it only removes positive accel, so a target
that is already braking passes through unchanged. The hold ends early if a lead within RELEASE_D_MAX that is closing
appears (the cap is harmless there, since the planner would already be braking for it). The trigger itself is
skipped during a lane change (modelV2.meta.laneChangeState != off) or with a turn signal on (carState.leftBlinker or
rightBlinker), since passing a slower car also releases its track and we want to accelerate there, and skipped while
the gas is pressed. Static/replay-evidence only, not driven.


Section 2, brake release smoothing and read-ahead:

Bosch-A brake release smoothing and short plan read-ahead (always on for Bosch-A Hondas, no toggle).

Ported from openpilot-radar ns-bosch-radar-testing, where these were tuned against mvl's sp-honda-dev planner:
  ffe967495d  brake release limit: while braking, the target rises at most BRAKE_RELEASE_JERK per second.
  927f430189  brake release dwell: a brake is held BRAKE_RELEASE_DWELL_TICKS cycles before it may rise.
  b03716e918  short plan read-ahead: the MPC plan is read PLANNER_ACTION_T_S ahead instead of delay + DT_MDL.
Not ported: 75f27bd6cd (coast-ceiling slew). It smoothed an output clip that stepped when the throttle gate flipped.
Neither planner here has that clip; the gate only limits a_cruise, which get_cruise_accel already slews.

Evidence: ns replay only (16 log windows, jerk RMS 0.82x, brake onset unchanged by the release steps). The read-ahead
cost there was the hardest brake onset up to 0.3 s later and closed-loop min gap 6.0 -> 5.6 m. These numbers came from
a different planner. Here the evidence is static and unit tests only.
