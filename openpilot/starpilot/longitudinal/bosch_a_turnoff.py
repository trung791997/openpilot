"""Bosch-A turn-off let-off: once a braking radar lead has been seen leaving our lane on the raw radar track, let the
brake off at FAST_JERK instead of BRAKE_RELEASE_JERK, and ask for no gas for NOGAS_S.

Owner report, route 000000cc 15:25 (2026-11-13): "my car was slowing down for a car turning right, and as the car
already turned to the right, my car slammed on the brake". The car ahead (radar track 22) slowed 13 -> 6 m/s while still
fused as leadOne, the command reached -3.43 as the radar released it, and the brake then let off at 2.5 m/s^3, so aEgo
peaked at -4.15 after the lead was gone.

Replay evidence (Job, open loop, bob-turnoff-arms3 @ 816b95048f arm A5C, scored per dir 2026-11-13):
  cc event: min target unchanged (-3.49); the brake reaches 0 by 926.8 s where the base is still at -1.37.
  main 1141 / second 99 episodes: score.py changed 0, harder 0, real_softer 0; fires on the real exits 9e s24, 7b s5,
  82 s6; does not fire on the radar dropouts 84 s7 and a2 s42 (lead still closing at about 1.25 m off centre);
  leaves the REAL brake 00000080 s19 untouched. No-gas cap binds 10.6 s over 8 main episodes (worst b3 s10 withholds
  +0.95 for 1.45 s). Fidelity 0.9489 vs 0.9494.
Rejected: the same let-off without the raw-track confirm (eased both dropouts) and a lateral aLeadK bound (softened the
REAL brake 80 s19 and acted on a2 s42 while the lead was under 1 m off centre and closing).

Trigger: the previous planner cycle's leadOne was a present radar lead closing faster than REL_VREL_MAX inside REL_D_MAX
with the target braking below REL_PREV_TARGET_MAX, and now leadOne is gone or a different, farther or non-closing lead.
Confirm: within CONFIRM_S the released track must still be in the raw radar tracks (radarTracks) and its |yRel| must have
grown by CONFIRM_DY to at least CONFIRM_Y. A track that vanishes or does not move out falls back to the base let-off.
While fast: a closing radar lead inside REL_D_MAX, or the watched track vanishing inside CLEAR_Y, ends it at once.
It only lets an existing brake off sooner and withholds gas; it never adds braking and never removes a radar point.
No raw tracks (radar fault, not subscribed) means nothing confirms, so it stays on the base let-off.
