"""Bosch-A ghost let-off (arm G, replay only): one rule for every brake that outlives its lead.

Owner, 2026-11-13: "ideally I want to develop a universal fix for all of those situations" (turn-offs, cut-outs,
radar dropouts, camera-only leads), replacing the turn-off trigger (bosch_a_turnoff.FastLetoff) and the release coast.

When the lead we were braking for leaves leadOne (gone, or replaced by a lead that is farther or not closing), it is kept
as a ghost: its last gap, speed and accel, moved forward in time. Each cycle the ghost gives the braking it still
justifies (a_req: stop behind it, assuming it keeps braking at min(aLeadK, 0) to a stop). The brake then lets off:
  - always at least at the base rate (BRAKE_RELEASE_JERK, unchanged);
  - faster, up to FAST_JERK, but never above the ghost's a_req (no evidence it left: physics alone bounds the let-off);
  - faster up to FAST_JERK all the way to the planner's target once the ghost is CLEARED.
Cleared means evidence the obstacle left our path: its raw radar track grew to |yRel| >= CLEAR_Y_LETOFF by at least
CLEAR_DY, or the camera's lead 0 has been absent (prob < CAM_CLEAR_PROB, or farther than ghost + CAM_FAR_M) for
CAM_CLEAR_S. Gas is withheld while the ghost lives and is not GAS-cleared (|yRel| >= CLEAR_Y_GAS, or the raw track
vanished after passing CLEAR_Y_LETOFF, or the ghost is behind us), for at most NOGAS_MAX_S.
The ghost dies when a lead within MERGE_M of it comes back (the planner owns it again), a closing lead inside
CLOSE_D_M appears, the ghost has been gas-cleared, or after GHOST_MAX_S.
It never adds braking (every output is min(target, ...) or a slower-than-planner rise) and never removes a radar point.
Radar dropout with the car still there: the camera still sees it and the raw track did not move out, so only a_req
applies; at short gaps a_req stays below the base let-off and nothing changes.
