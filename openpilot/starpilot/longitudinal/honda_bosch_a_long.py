"""Honda Bosch A Long Enhancement: longitudinal behavior that is active whenever the Bosch-A radar is on.

Ported from openpilot-radar (ns-bosch-radar-testing @ 567495f4ad + 6db22115e8, selfdrive/controls/lib/longitudinal_planner.py).
Active only when `active_for(CP)`: a Honda in VERIFIED_BOSCH_A_CARS with openpilot longitudinal and the radar not
disabled (`HondaBoschARadar`), which is the same gate radard uses to build BoschALeadPolicy. Each part also has its own
switch: Stock Brake Feel is permanent (owner 2026-11-11: "Make Stock Brake Feel permanent"; the BoschAStockBrakeFeel
toggle and its settings row are removed). HumanFollowing and HumanAcceleration are always on too (owner 2026-11-13: no
toggle, default for all Bosch-A cars; the HumanFollowing owner toggle is removed). Everything in this class needs the radar on
(owner 2026-11-13; bosch_a_toggles.long_tuning_active); HumanFollowing and HumanAcceleration still run vision-only. Both longitudinal planners (StarPilot's and the upstream one) call it the
same way. The D-077 birth-rail ramps (off, never wired to radard here) were removed 2026-11-11; the code and its
evidence comment are in git at 3f26fb513c and in openpilot-radar radard.py @ 567495f4ad.

Contents:
- Stock Brake Feel (D-086, D-100, D-103, D-120): stock Honda ACC's TTC depth and jerk tables, with the soft exit,
  takeover hold, lead-stop law (<= 20 s) and the emergency latch.
- Brake onset ramp (2026-11-05, folded into step() 2026-11-11): a brake that starts with every lead far away deepens at
  most ONSET_JERK per second; with the law always on it only binds inside the emergency pass-through.
- Coast first (depth floor; folded in from bosch_a_coast_first.py 2026-11-11): for a distant lead tapping its brakes, the
  law's target is floored at COAST_ACCEL and the floor descends at COAST_RAMP_JERK. It runs last inside step(), on every
  return path, when the caller passes `follow_s`.
- Need floor (2026-11-11, NEED_FLOOR_ENABLED, on; replay only): need_floor() raises a braking target to -max(need, 0.8)
  for a steady closing moving lead, after smooth and stop gap; called from longitudinal_planner.py only.

- Newborn lead aLeadK bound (D-080, restored 2026-11-11 as NEWBORN_HOLD_ENABLED, on): planner_radar_state() holds a
  newborn radar lead's aLeadK at -1.0 unless its own range history confirms the braking (MPC and law input only).

The planner calls `step()` once per cycle, after the other target owners and before release coast, smooth and stop gap.
Depth shaping (the law, the onset ramp, then the coast-first floor) is this one call. Every limit
here only shapes how a brake builds or lets off; the emergency latch passes the planner's target through untouched,
so the car never brakes harder than the planner would without this module. Replay and limited road evidence only.

HumanFollowing and HumanAcceleration are separate modules (human_following.py, human_acceleration.py) because they
also run with the radar off (vision-only).

# Brake onset ramp: a brake that starts with every lead far away builds at ONSET_JERK instead of in one frame.
#
# Owner 2026-11-05: "Why can we just mimic stock brake for those situations? Instead of just slamming the brake".
# Stock ACC on route 299 (STATUS 214) brings a brake in at -1.4..-3.4 m/s^3 per step; ours stepped at -36..-52 m/s^3
# on the route 84 far brakes (E1, E4), e2ae and e2f8. The old D-083 ramp (6f1a05b37) would not have changed them: its
# lead-braking and need gates stand it down on every one, because the lead is already braking hard at onset.
#
# Replay (Job, base dad6bbbb6, open loop, arm R4b; limited road evidence, not driven):
#   - first-jolt jerk 44-52 -> 8 m/s^3 on 84 E1/E4/vn84_3/vn84_11, 34 -> 8 on e2ae, 43 -> 8 on e2f8; peak decel unchanged
#     (-3.5 stays -3.5), onset at -2 at most 0.15 s later.
#   - min gap 0.4-0.9 m smaller on those events (e2ae: -0.62 m, ending at 4.8 m); min TTC within 0.08 s.
#   - the 2f5 close stop (onset dRel 38.1 m) is exempt and equals today's output; pooled 0.85 h: same brake episode
#     counts, no episode closer by more than 2 m.
#   - nothing at onset (need, closing speed) separates e2ae/2f5 from the 84 far brakes; only the onset distance does.
#     EXEMPT_D_M = 40 sits between 2f5 (38.1 m) and e2f8 (43.9 m); 30 m capped 2f5 and cost it 0.36 m.
#   - an in-brake close-gap stand-down (R5) changed nothing: the ramp finishes in ~0.4 s, before the gap gets close.
#
# Channels: reads radarState leadOne/leadTwo (present, dRel, vRel) as published; a railed vRel (U11 low rail -12) only
# makes TTC smaller, which stands the ramp down, never extends it. Only the fall rate of the target is capped; the peak is
# never reduced, rises pass through, and dRel/vLead/radar points are untouched (D-041/D-042).
#
# With the law always on (owner 2026-11-11), the ramp only binds inside the emergency pass-through, where the law
# hands the planner's target through untouched; on the scorecard baseline (44f382face, 36 routes) that was 10 frames in

# about 2 s (aLeadK to -3.0, vLead 32.5 -> 25.4) and was back on the gas 1.5 s later. The planner went 0 -> -2.25 in
# 0.75 s. The closest gap was 50.9 m / 1.64 s. A coast at -0.5 from the same onset reaches about 49.5 m / 1.65 s

#
# While the gap is well clear, the brake is staged instead of cut: the target is floored at COAST_ACCEL when braking
# starts and the floor descends at COAST_RAMP_JERK, so a lead that keeps braking still gets the full brake 1-2 s later.
# Every tick re-checks a projection: the lead keeps its current decel (aLeadK, no recovery assumed) and we follow the
# staged floor for COAST_HORIZON_S; if the projected gap ever drops under COAST_FLOOR_GAP_S * v + COAST_FLOOR_GAP_M, or
# the time gap is under follow + COAST_GAP_MARGIN_S, or TTC, lead decel or FCW trip, the floor is dropped at once and the
