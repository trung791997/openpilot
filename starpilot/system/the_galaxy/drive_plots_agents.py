"""Per-drive numbers the lateral and longitudinal agents asked for (2026-09-28), computed from Plots recordings and,
through tools/drive_plots/rlog_report.py, from any route's rlogs:

- driver takeovers, per episode and route-wide: Driver override (Kevin) and Metadrive Sim (John), whose gate uses the
  same definitions (hold swing, release overshoot, back on plan, release step, drift toward the push);
- radar / longitudinal moments: Radar Work (Bob);
- lane centring, angle tracking, feedforward, integrator and tight-turn lag per speed band: VFN Shadow controller
  (James), for LatControlClarityEps.

Pure functions over the recorder's column dict ``c`` (name -> float array). NaN means "not recorded" (a recording made
before the column existed, or a message that never arrived); every metric that needs a missing column is None, never a
number built from zeros. Times: ``t`` in the output is seconds from the start of the arrays and ``mono_s`` is the
frame's logMonoTime in seconds, so a caller can convert exactly (the rlog report turns it into seconds from the
route's first logMonoTime).

Sign conventions: wheel angle and steeringTorque are + = left; lat_des and des_curv are + = right. lane_off is the
car's offset from the lane centre, + = car left of centre (modelV2 laneLines y is + = right, so the centre's y at x=0
is the car's offset to the left). "Toward the push" is + in the direction the driver pushed the wheel.

Not recorded, so never reconstructed here (James): the controller output before its low-pass filter, ff_ramp on its
own, the modified EPS's own pressed signal, and design C's driver-led offset/flag. carState.steeringPressed is the raw
pressed bit, so takeovers are labelled "raw pressed". Bosch-A gate internals are not published on any
cereal message (Bob); leadOne.radar and radarTrackId are the published proxies.
