Linux native AIO (io_submit), for the gadget's endpoint writes.

A synchronous FunctionFS write holds the endpoint's one usb_request, and
epfile->mutex with it, until the host has taken every byte, so a frame sent as
32 KB writes leaves the bus idle between them: 1.4 ms a frame at 13 writes,
2.8 ms at 25 (2026-10-06 bench, against one 512 KB write). The AIO path in
ffs_epfile_io gives each iocb its own request, copies the iocb's bytes into it
and queues it before io_submit moves on, then lets go of the mutex. dwc3 puts
every queued request on its TRB ring, so the bus streams them back to back,
and the caller's buffers are free again the moment io_submit returns.

Only what FfsTransport needs: one context, PWRITEV iocbs, and reaping. Linux
only: the comma is aarch64, and CI's x86_64 runs the real thing too.
