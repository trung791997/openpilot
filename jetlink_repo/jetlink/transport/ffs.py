USB gadget side of the link: a FunctionFS vendor-specific bulk function.

On a comma this is the comma end. The roles look backwards and are not: AGNOS
has CONFIG_USB_F_FS built in, while a host needs no kernel driver at all, which
an L4T rootfs stripped of the gadget modules does not have. See
docs/transport.md.

Bring-up (scripts/comma/jetlink-root.sh gadget does all of this):
    configfs gadget -> functions/ffs.jetlink -> mount -t functionfs
    write descriptors + strings to ep0 -> ep1 (OUT) and ep2 (IN) appear
