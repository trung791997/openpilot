The spec of the last model a server built (the pick, or a stand-in for it), and whether its engine is built, in one record.

Reading the shapes and output slices means parsing a 766 MB ONNX. The server
does that when it builds the engine and answers with the spec; provisioning
keeps the answer here, and modeld reads it and never touches the file. The
record also says whether the server has built the engine for the sha it names,
so the spec and the readiness can never name different models. It must
survive a reboot, or every ignition rebuilds a 160 s engine.

A param today (Keys.spec), through the adapter's get and put.
