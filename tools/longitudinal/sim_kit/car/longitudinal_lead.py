"""Shared, side-effect-free lead physics for BLoTv3.

The planner and the 100 Hz final-stop controller run in different processes,
so they cannot share state. They can, however, share one definition of a
usable lead and one relative-motion calculation. Keeping that math here
prevents the two policy layers from disagreeing about the same vehicle.
