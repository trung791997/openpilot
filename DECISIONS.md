# Decisions

Settled decisions and the reasoning behind them. **Do not relitigate these without new
evidence** — if you have new evidence, add a superseding entry rather than editing the old
one.

Format: what was decided, what was rejected, why.

### On the numbering

Numbers are **inherited from the EPS knowledge-base repo** so cross-references between the
two projects stay valid. **D-001 … D-026 are EPS firmware decisions** (hook placement, the
code cave, RWD build/verify, UART/UDS flashing, telemetry v1–v5, the gain bench) and live in
that repo, not here. They are intentionally absent rather than renumbered.

Carried into this repo: **D-009, D-010, D-027 … D-038**. New decisions made in this repo
start at **D-039** and continue upward.

---

## D-009 — Every assertion suite needs a negative control
**Decided 2026-07-28. Applies here unchanged.** A suite of passing assertions is
unfalsifiable until one of them is shown to fail when the mechanism is broken on purpose.

Concretely in this repo: if a test asserts that a gate suppresses a bad radar point, it must
be paired with a case proving the point *is* published when the gate is removed. Without it,
the passing assertions look identical to a harness that simply observes nothing. This repo
has already paid for the general version of this — see `d8604bd`, where the test evidence for
four defects was measuring a stale mirror of the value under test and passed either way.

## D-010 — Git is the timestamp; artifacts are content-addressed
**Decided 2026-07-28. Applies here unchanged.** No dates in filenames. Commit per session as
`YYYY-MM-DD <what changed>`; tag milestones; `STATUS.md` carries one `As of:` date.

In this repo, the content address of a claim is the pair **(route ID, commit SHA)**. A replay
number without both is not reproducible, because a replay result inherits the code it ran on.

## D-027 — The James night-star experiment keeps James's SR and adds observability only
**Decided 2026-08-21.** The alternate OpenPilot experiment starts from JamesL787
`night-star-bosch-radar` and retains its CR-V road-measured direct six-point steering-ratio
curve unchanged. Runtime telemetry identifies this as profile 5. Profile 4 remains reserved
for arc-dev's firmware-extracted 30-point curve, so replay cannot silently substitute one
implementation for the other.

Ported scope is additive OpenPilot PID/mechanism telemetry and the coherent nine-frame EPS
extractor. Rejected: transplanting arc-dev's firmware VGR, current-curvature hook, or
learned/fixed hybrid behaviour into this comparison branch. Those changes would prevent an
A/B evaluation of James's implementation and would violate the requested scope.

## D-028 — Bosch-A radar support remains an explicit RX-only experiment
**Decided 2026-08-22.** `HONDA_CRV_5G` may use the hand-written Bosch-A object decoder
because two content-retained vehicle logs prove the complete 16-slot object family and the
`0x2FF` sweep trigger are present on the same camera-side bus the Civic implementation
parses. The platform allowlist is **one named set shared by `CarInterface` and `radard`**, so
parser availability and the radar-rate fusion behaviour cannot silently diverge.

The tester toggle remains **required and default-off**. Rejected: enabling the decoder for
every Honda Bosch fingerprint; making it default-on; or treating stationary no-target
sentinels as proof that real target geometry, relative velocity, association, planner
consumption, or vehicle behaviour is correct. Those require a comma build followed by
controlled live-target and road validation. This change is RX-only and does not alter the
steering-ratio implementation.

> **Naming, as of this repo:** the toggle is `BoschARadar` (param `BoschARadar`; UI
> Longitudinal → "Bosch A Radar"), and the car set / prefixes are `HONDA_BOSCH_A` /
> `HONDA_BOSCH_A_*`. The earlier `NrdrBoschARadar` and `civic_bosch_radar` / `CIVIC_BOSCH_*`
> names were renamed in `af4ea03`/`cdfde65` and `fa0552c`, and the non-functional
> `BoschLong` toggle was removed at the same time. The decision above is unchanged; only the
> identifiers moved. `common/params_keys.h` also still carries a separate legacy
> `HondaBoschARadar` key — do not add a third.

## D-029 — StarPilot keeps Konik selection but adopts bounded durable registration
**Decided 2026-08-22.** The alternate branch retains StarPilot's `UseKonikServer` setting and
defaults it to Konik, while adopting arc-dev's durable identity separation under
`/data/community/identity`. A saved Konik identity is authoritative across params resets and
is never written over the factory comma identity. Explicit server switching remains
supported.

Remote registration failure must not block manager indefinitely or manufacture a plausible
random dongle ID. After a bounded attempt (60 s) it records the explicit unregistered state
so setup can continue and report the failure. Rejected: switching this branch to comma
servers, removing the independent background API, or importing arc-dev steering/controller
behaviour as part of the registration repair.

## D-030 — Night-star CR-V starts from the effective arc/nrdr lateral profile
**Decided 2026-08-22.** The modified-EPS `HONDA_CRV_5G` profile follows James
`84f1b7ec789b`: retain StarPilot's DBC-aligned `[0,3840]` identity request mapping while
importing the effective arc/nrdr four-point P/I and feedforward schedules. StarPilot's schema
lacks `kfBP/kfV`, so the feedforward curve remains an explicit runtime selector with `3.6e-6`
as the `CarParams` fallback.

The P/I fine-trim Params default to neutral 100% so the declared `CarParams` tune is the
effective baseline. A migration rewrites **only** the exact untouched legacy `100/135/200`
tuple; custom or partial profiles are preserved. Rejected: keeping the stale flat CR-V tune;
stacking hidden speed multipliers on the explicit schedule; treating the EPS-internal 30,000
command-map endpoint as an OpenPilot CAN command; or copying nrdr's 4096 request endpoint —
the source commit keeps 3840, which matches the Honda DBC's documented range. The new gain
schedules still require a new build and controlled road validation.

## D-031 — CR-V Alpha Long stays disabled until gas and brake use one command domain
**Decided 2026-09-03.** Route `00000002--aa8501ddcb` captures P061B beginning at
951.918310 s during a continuous positive-gas / negative-acceleration / brake-bit
contradiction. The installed source selects gas from adjusted `gas_force` and braking from
raw `accel`, permitting both.

Rejected: treating the fault as a device memory leak — post-engagement RAM and control-process
RSS remain stable, with no OOM or restart. Also rejected: continuing road reproduction on the
defective command path, or attributing the event to MAF/air-filter hardware without new
evidence, given the clean stock-ACC / manual-pedal A/B and the exact software-command/DTC
timing captured here.

## D-032 — Publish the P061B fix as an isolated test branch, not a merge
**Decided 2026-09-03.** `fix-honda-alpha-long-p061b` at `6e583e1c43c5…` is based exactly on
the faulting `7f2bab7b…` commit. The captured failure and the general mutual-exclusion
invariant are both regression-tested.

Rejected: merging directly into the owner's normal driving branch, or calling the change
verified from static tests. The branch stays isolated until a controlled vehicle A/B shows
that P061B does not recur and longitudinal behaviour remains acceptable.

## D-033 — Withdraw the raw-zero P061B gate after its first vehicle test
**Decided 2026-09-04.** Do not continue testing `6e583e1c43c5…` in traffic. Route
`00000003--1423cb6de2` proves it suppresses a positive calculated gas value for 23.96 of
87.3 engaged seconds and immediately reapplies hundreds of gas units across raw-acceleration
zero, creating a severe speed sawtooth. The static gas/brake mutual-exclusion tests were
necessary but insufficient.

Rejected: reading the absence of P061B in this route as validation — the engagement lasted
87.3 s against ~585 s before the original fault. Also rejected: reverting to the unmodified
`gas_force` gate, which restores the proven gas-plus-brake conflict. A future candidate must
preserve road-load compensation **and** explicit gas/brake mutual exclusion together.

## D-034 — Replace the raw-zero gate with compensated gas plus brake inhibition
**Decided 2026-09-04.** Candidate `57d77a7e1918…` restores the positive-`gas_force` decision
so freeway drag/grade compensation survives raw-acceleration zero, and adds `not braking` as
a hard gas condition. Open-loop replay restores all 1,198 gas frames removed by the defective
candidate and suppresses all 1,584 original gas-plus-brake frames.

Rejected: merely reverting `6e583e1c…`, which recreates the contradiction; or treating
open-loop command replay as proof of closed-loop behaviour. The candidate still sends
positive gas with negative non-braking `ACCEL_COMMAND`; whether Honda accepts that over a
long engagement remains a vehicle-validation question.

## D-035 — Do not tune the lead planner around the compensated-gate regression
**Decided 2026-09-04.** Route `00000004--dcc6a5b59e` shows `57d77a7e1918…` resolves the
simultaneous transmitted gas/brake command but still selects those modes from **different
physical quantities** — braking from raw `accel < −0.2`, propulsion from acceleration plus
grade and aero compensation. Of 3,916 logged brake frames, 2,336 have positive reconstructed
adjusted force. The next candidate arbitrates gas, coast and brake from that same
adjusted-force quantity with stateful hysteresis near zero, retaining explicit stop/hold and
urgent-deceleration tests.

Rejected: retuning lead-follow acceleration to conceal the downstream mode discontinuity.
The described natural behaviour is observational evidence, not a policy, and the pre-fix
controller already felt smooth before its simultaneous gas/brake defect was exposed. Also
rejected: treating the illustrative `−0.12/−0.02 m/s²` thresholds as final — they reduce
logged brake runs 39 → 11 in open-loop replay only, and this route retains just 3.70 s of
decline activity, which cannot establish a two-sided tune.

## D-036 — Test same-force-domain Bosch arbitration with a stateful coast band
**Decided 2026-09-04.** Publish experimental candidate `694046f33f58…` on the existing
isolated branch. It enters braking when adjusted tractive force falls below `−0.12 m/s²`,
releases above `−0.02 m/s²`, forces braking in the stopping state, and retains the
independent CAN-boundary rule that gas requires **both** positive adjusted force and no
brake. Propulsion, coast and ordinary braking now use one physical domain without weakening
the P061B mutual-exclusion invariant.

The thresholds are an experimental selection, not a final tune. Rejected: keeping D-034's raw
`−0.2 m/s²` brake bit, which route 4 proves taps the brake during positive tractive effort;
using adjusted force with no hysteresis, which leaves a 50 Hz sign boundary; removing the
stopping override; or claiming the candidate verified from replay — a changed command
invalidates the recorded future closed loop.

## D-037 — Base the Alpha Long PR on the current James target tip
**Decided 2026-09-05.** Merge the current JamesL787 `ns-bosch-radar-testing` tip into the
isolated candidate and open the result as PR #9. The branch contains the complete target
history through `3f27c6faaf5b…` via merge `1ddce1708420…`; the comparison is clean and
confined to the three intended Honda Alpha Long files.

Rejected: opening review from the stale `7f2bab7b…` base, which would show eight intervening
radar/planner commits as divergence; rebasing away the experimental history after an explicit
request to merge into the existing test branch; or treating `MERGEABLE` as road validation.

> **Superseded in part by D-047.** This entry recorded the planner/`radard` tests as
> "locally uncollected because the checked-in `msgq/ipc_pyx.so` is not valid Mach-O." That
> was an architecture mismatch, not a corrupt artifact, and it is solvable. Re-run those
> suites before citing this decision's coverage claims.

## D-038 — Port the final force-domain fix to StarPilot without retuning MVL
**Decided 2026-09-06.** Base the StarPilot port exactly on Firestar `Dom` `9d1043ad0114…`
and adapt the ordinary Honda Bosch path to StarPilot's `CarParams` CAN-packer API. Ordinary
Bosch passes the same adjusted force used to calculate gas magnitude, applies stateful
`−0.12/−0.02 m/s²` brake hysteresis plus stopping override, and repeats mutual exclusion at
the CAN boundary. Preserve the separate Accord 11G MVL force crossover through the optional
legacy selector; there is **no route evidence authorizing an MVL retune**.

Rejected: cherry-picking the James commit without adaptation, which would discard StarPilot's
`CarParams` interface and MVL behaviour; keeping raw acceleration as ordinary Bosch mode
selection; or describing the user-reported absence of new DTCs as proof.

## D-039 — Bosch-A is one 16-slot bank, and its DBC is hand-written and enforcing
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15 from the implementation.** The wire format is a
single 16-slot object bank: four main frames per slot (`f0..f3`, one CAN ID each — **not**
sub-frames muxed onto a shared ID) plus one synchronized auxiliary frame.

This supersedes two earlier models that were wrong: `0x280/0x284/0x288/0x28C` as pieces of
one object, and `0x2C8/0x2C9` as a separate "coarse" object list. Both are retired.

`opendbc/dbc/honda_bosch_a_radar.dbc` is written by hand and is deliberately **not** produced
by the opendbc generator pipeline. It declares the real Honda rolling `COUNTER` (2-bit, last
byte bits 5:4) and `CHECKSUM` (4-bit, bits 3:0) so opendbc enforces them — verified
361,360/361,360 checksum passes and 214,400/214,400 sequential counter transitions on route
`000001df`. `FRAME_IDX` and `LIFECYCLE_RAW` are intentionally *not* named `COUNTER`.

Rejected: generating this DBC, which cannot express the bank geometry; and naming the
per-slot frame index `COUNTER`, which would make opendbc enforce the wrong field.

## D-040 — Decode constants come from the firmware, not from fitting against vision
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15.** Range scale is `1/16` m/count and azimuth is
`(raw − 1024)/2048` rad, both derived from the firmware's own arithmetic and independently
corroborated (see `STATUS.md`). The range **offset** is a per-unit calibration value
(`−n/128`, `n` from a config word plus a runtime addend); `−3.0` is a retained plausible
value, and the right way to improve it is to **read the radar's configuration**.

Rejected: the previous `0.05712` scale, which was `16 × 0.00357` where the `0.00357` had been
solved from a **single tape point with the offset assumed** — it read ~9% short, −9 m at 60 m
against vision. Also rejected: re-fitting either constant against the vision lead. Vision is
not a range reference, and a two-parameter fit against it will silently trade scale for
offset and look good in the middle of the range.

## D-041 — A saturation rail is a bound, and it must still be published
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15.** U11 raw `0` and `1728` mean `|vRel| ≥ 13.5 m/s`
with the exact value unrecoverable. Publish the rail. Do **not** treat it as a missing
measurement.

This was briefly routed to the coast path, and it was a safety regression. A stationary car
approached above 13.5 m/s (30 mph) rails on *every* sweep, so the coast never ended, it
outlived `BOSCH_A_STALE_S`, and the radar point was **deleted**. Route `000001f9` at 29:52:
two stopped cars, 88 of 88 active frames on the low rail with healthy u10 (78–94), range
closing smoothly at −19.4 m/s. `radard` fell back to a vision lead reporting only −11.4 m/s;
the planner commanded **0.00 while closing on stopped traffic at 76 m with a 6.6 s TTC**, and
the driver intervened. Restored in `6126e51`.

Publishing the rail understates closing (a stopped car reads as `vLead = vEgo − 13.5`) and
that understatement is why it looked worth "fixing". **Understating closing still brakes;
deleting the object does not.** Recovering the true value past the rail needs the range
channel and is deliberately left to a separate, validated change.

Generalise this: **when a radar gate is uncertain, the safe direction is to publish a
degraded bound, not to coast.** Every coast has a deadline, and the deadline deletes the car.

## D-042 — The u10 threshold is 511, validated by replay; do not re-tune it from statistics
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15.** `BOSCH_A_DIRECT_VREL_MAX_UNCERTAINTY_RAW =
511`, validated in `d5000fe344` by replaying 20 bookmarks through the real `RadarInterface`
and `radard`'s Kalman filter, where it collapsed recorded `aLeadK` spikes up to −26.5 m/s².

It was lowered to 128 on error statistics alone. That undid the validated result and caused a
measured regression: route `000001f3` at 19:27, u10 sat above 128 for 0.81 s during a real
~8 m/s² lead decel, the coast outlived `BOSCH_A_STALE_S`, the lead was deleted, and the
vision fallback injected a 5 m / 6 m/s step driving a −3.51 m/s² brake. Restored in `39c0f09`.

The reason the statistics mislead: **u10 is confounded with dynamics.** Across 16,834 frames,
median |err| rises 0.26 → 0.88 → 1.44 → 1.95 m/s over u10 bins 0-64/64-128/128-192/192-256,
but median |a_rel| rises 0.73 → 2.13 → 3.51 → 4.59 m/s² alongside it
(`corr(u10,|err|) = +0.40`, `corr(u10,|a_rel|) = +0.43`). Holding dynamics out, the quality
signal is real (calm-frame corr +0.52) — but u10 climbs during genuine hard braking just as
reliably, so a lower threshold **preferentially rejects real manoeuvring**.

Rejected: tuning this number from offline error statistics at all. What must stay safe is the
coast path (D-041), not this threshold.

## D-043 — The multi-sweep velocity/range consistency check is one-sided
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15.** Compare U11 against a range rate fitted over
several sweeps, and reject **only** "U11 claims more closing than the geometry supports."

Two reasons it cannot be symmetric. U11 *lags* true closure at a deceleration onset — at
`000001f3` 19:27 the fitted range rate was −6.7 m/s while U11 still read −2.08 — so a
symmetric `|U11 − rate|` test fires during genuine hard braking, exactly when the velocity
matters most. And lag can only make U11 *under*-report closing while a lead brakes, so only
the other direction is evidence of a fault. In the mirror case (a lead accelerating away) the
one-sided test coasts a more-conservative velocity, so it fails safe.

Scope, measured on nine flagged events: this catches **gross** disagreement — `000001eb` 6:59
reported `vRel −10.58 m/s` while the range was *opening* at +0.46 m/s, an 11 m/s
contradiction across a track-identity change. It deliberately does **not** chase the milder
0.6–2.5 m/s overshoots at deceleration onset; a trailing window legitimately lags during real
braking, and those are the u10 gate's job.

Rejected: relying on the per-sweep innovation gate to catch velocity error. Over one ~70 ms
sweep, even a 3 m/s error moves the range 0.2 m — far under its 2–5 m thresholds. That gate
has no power here at all.

## D-044 — The range-derived vRel is shadow telemetry; nothing consumes it
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15.** `Track.vRelRange` publishes a 5-sample LSQ
range rate alongside the radar's own `vRel`, for **whichever** radar lead is selected — not
only Bosch-A — so the two can be compared on real drives. It is wired to **no** control path.

It is plain LSQ with **no outlier rejection**, so it inherits the range channel's ~1% gross
outliers: read it as a diagnostic, never as a validated velocity. Timestamps come from the
message clock rather than wall clock, because wall-clock time made every accelerated replay
of this field meaningless. Duplicate payloads are excluded (`measurement_update=False`) so a
repeated frame cannot forge a zero-`dt` sample, and a stale or gappy history is rejected
outside `[0.12, 0.60] s`.

Why it exists: on `000001fe/fb/fd`, U11 detects a closing onset 0.88–1.28 s late while a
4-sample range LSQ lands within 0.07–0.14 s; on `00000141` R141-8, U11 diverged from the
range by 13.7 m/s while the range moved 1.9 m.

Rejected: wiring it into control before a drive confirms or refutes it. Also rejected:
diverging `RANGE_VREL_SAMPLES` from the minimum fit length — the deque length and the minimum
are deliberately the same constant.

## D-045 — Publish RadarPoints on the last main frame, never on the auxiliary frame
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15.** `BOSCH_A_TRIGGER_MSG` is slot 15's fourth main
frame (`0x2FF`). Passive captures prove slot 15's companion frame `0x297` follows it and is
the final observed object-family frame in a full sweep.

Rejected: making `0x297` the trigger. One dropped auxiliary frame would then suppress an
otherwise-valid point update, contradicting the parser's contract that **aux never gates
validity**. The companion data stays optional/debug-only, and that is the whole point.

## D-046 — The lead Kalman dt comes from the measured cadence, not a round number
**Decided in this repo; recorded 2026-09-15.** `BOSCH_A_FREQ_HZ = 14.35`, the median of
`0x280` inter-arrival across the retained routes (p5 12.5, p95 16.9). `radard` derives
`HONDA_BOSCH_A_RADAR_TS` from it, so the lead Kalman filter runs at the rate the radar
actually measures at.

Rejected: the previous round `15`, which ran the filter ~4.5% fast. Note this is **not** the
rate `radard` itself is driven at — that is the ~20 Hz model rate — which is why the duplicate
payload path exists at all: a Bosch-A measurement must not be absorbed twice.

## D-047 — The checked-in device binaries are aarch64; rebuild rather than reporting "cannot run"
**Decided 2026-09-15.** The `.so` files tracked in this repo (`msgq/ipc_pyx.so`,
`common/params_pyx.so`, `common/transformations/transformations.so`, the acados solvers) are
built for the comma device and are **ARM aarch64**. On any other host they fail to load with
`cannot open shared object file`, which reads like a missing file rather than a wrong
architecture.

This has been recorded at least three times across prior status writeups as "the
radard/planner tests cannot run on this checkout" — on macOS as "not a valid Mach-O binary",
on Linux as "is a Linux binary". In every case the tests were runnable after a local
`scons` build. **366 radar and longitudinal tests pass** once the tree is rebuilt; the exact
recipe is in `STATUS.md` → *Build and test environment*.

Standing rule: **do not report a test as unrunnable until you have tried that recipe**, and
do not cite a coverage claim that was skipped for this reason without re-running it.

Corollary, and it cuts the other way: **a local build overwrites 26 tracked device binaries
in place**, so after building, `git status` shows them modified. Committing them would ship
x86_64 artifacts to a branch that boots on an aarch64 comma. Stage explicitly; never
`git commit -a`. Rebuilding a device artifact on purpose is its own commit that says so
(`a972d15` is the pattern), never a side effect of running tests.

Also settled here: the repo-root **`.venv` is a tracked symlink to another machine's home
directory** (`/Users/jameslichtenstiger/nrdr/openpilot/.venv`, mode `120000`, from `82796af`)
and breaks `uv sync`. Work around it with `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT`. Rejected: deleting the
tracked link as a side effect of unrelated work — it is a one-line commit of its own, and it
belongs in a change that is about the build environment and nothing else.

## D-048 — Corroboration bounds a radar lead's braking authority; it never deletes the point
**Proposed 2026-09-15 from a six-segment corpus. NOT IMPLEMENTED — see the validation gate
at the end before writing any code.**

### The failure this addresses

On `00000231--5782493b00` t=9.1–11.35 s, radar track 6 (the selected lead, own lane) walked
its range from 71.8 to 61.6 m with U11 ramping to −6.02 m/s while the vision lead held
75–78 m at `prob` ≥ 0.93. The planner commanded −2.89 m/s², the driver felt −4.28 and
overrode with the accelerator. Track 6 then coasted, froze, and disappeared for 11.02 s.

**Every existing gate passed it, and two of them structurally cannot ever catch it:**

- The per-sweep range innovation gate saw ~0.25 m per sweep against a 2.0 m limit.
- D-043's one-sided U11-vs-range check compares two channels that **both come from the same
  radar track**. Here they agreed with each other (−6.0 vs −4.5…−6.4). When a track migrates
  onto the wrong scatterer, its range and its velocity stay mutually consistent while both
  describe the wrong object. No radar-internal cross-check can see this.
- D-044's shadow `vRelRange` is an LSQ fit of that same range, so it agrees too. **Record
  this against D-044: it can cross-check U11, but it can never cross-check the range.**
- `HONDA_BOSCH_A_GROSS_DISTANCE_M = 25.0` saw a 15.8 m peak disagreement.

### What was rejected first, on evidence

**Tightening `HONDA_BOSCH_A_GROSS_DISTANCE_M`.** Refuted by the corpus: pooled radar/vision
gap is median +4.0, p95 +14.9, max +27.7 m, and segment `9e21cac9` sustains a **median 13.8 m
gap with no hard braking at all**. A ~12 m threshold fires continuously where nothing is
wrong.

**Re-confirmed on 8 whole routes, 2026-09-17** (`an2/visgap.py`, 121 min, 140k radar-lead frames
with a confident model lead). The radar/vision range gap is banded by range: |gap| p50 is 1.4–2.5 m
below 40 m but 4.8–14.9 m at 60–80 m, and at d >= 60 m it reaches >= 10 m on **31.5 %** and >= 15 m
on **13.1 %** of radar-lead frames (5,921 / 2,463 of 18,782). Those frames are **not** where the
braking is: `aTarget <= -2 m/s^2` within the next 3 s is equal to or *lower* than the same-route
baseline on 6 of 7 routes with far-lead frames (e.g. 239 3.5 % vs 6.4 %, 23f 2.0 % vs 4.3 %; only
237 is higher, 11.3 % vs 7.9 %), and driver braking within 6 s is not elevated. So the 15.8 m gap in
the 231 fault sits inside the ordinary distribution, and no absolute-gap threshold separates it.
Caveats: the model lead is assumed to be the same object (not verified laterally), and "the radar is
right" is proxied by "nothing bad followed", not by ground truth.

**Gating on the radar/vision range-*slope* disagreement** (each sensor rating its own range over a
2 s window, so it is not range-relative in the D-044 sense). Refuted by the same run: at 60–80 m
|radar slope − vision slope| is p50 1.7–3.0 m/s and p90 5.1–9.5 m/s, because the vision range is too
jittery at that distance. The 231 fault's worst frame is 7.9 m/s, around p90 of normal driving, and
its earlier, still-faulty frames are ~2.5 m/s, at the median. No threshold both catches the fault and
stays quiet.

**Gating on d(gap)/dt.** Refuted: |d(gap)/dt| is p95 31 m/s, max 130 m/s, dominated by the
vision model's frame-to-frame `x` jitter; `9e21cac9` reaches p95 53.7 m/s while braking
normally.

**Switching to the vision lead when radar looks wrong.** Rejected on existing evidence, not
new work: D-042 records that exactly this hard switch injected a 5 m / 6 m/s step and drove a
−3.51 m/s² brake. A fix that hard-switches recreates a regression already paid for.

**Deleting or coasting the suspect point.** Rejected outright — that is D-041, and doing it
cost a driver intervention on stopped traffic.

### The decision

Give each radar track a **corroboration score**: a slow EMA of how well its range has agreed
with the vision lead while the two were matched, plus how much of its recent history was
`measured` rather than coasted. The score bounds **how much deceleration authority that track
may command** — it never gates publication.

Three properties are load-bearing:

1. **The point is always published.** Corroboration changes authority, not existence
   (D-041). A poorly-corroborated lead still brakes; it brakes *less hard*.
2. **Authority is blended, never switched.** Low corroboration moves the commanded
   deceleration toward what the vision-implied kinematics support, continuously. No
   discontinuity, so the D-042 step-injection cannot recur.
3. **Corroboration is slow; urgency overrides it.** The score must not react to
   frame-to-frame vision jitter (see the refuted gap-rate candidate), so it is an EMA over
   seconds. Any genuinely urgent geometry — small range, short TTC — **bypasses the bound
   entirely**. A fix that softens real emergency braking is worse than the fault it fixes.

### Where it lives

**`selfdrive/controls/radard.py`, not the parser.** `opendbc`'s `radar_interface.py` has no
access to `modelV2` and never should; the corroborating signal is vision, so this must sit
above the parser, after `match_vision_to_track` and before the lead is published. It is a new
layer on top of the existing chain (sentinels → innovation → u10 → D-043 rate check → rail
publish → staleness → Kalman → vision match → preferred-track staleness), and it changes none
of them.

### Validation gate — do not implement before this is satisfied

The corpus has **four** hard-brake events, one of them the fault. That cannot validate a
threshold, and D-042 is explicit about what happens when a constant is tuned on partial
evidence. Before any code:

1. Enough routes to see the radar/vision residual distribution **separately for tracks that
   later prove good versus tracks that later die** — track 6's 11 s disappearance suggests
   mortality is the label to train against.
2. A replay harness that re-runs the corpus and asserts **zero reduction in authority on the
   five benign segments** — the negative control D-009 requires.
3. The parameters chosen from that distribution, not from the single fault.

Until then this is a design, and the repo carries it as one.

## D-049 — The incarnation boundary is not published; the lead KF reset rides on one message
**Recorded 2026-09-15 from static analysis and tests against `bdf98de`. NOT IMPLEMENTED — the
fix is not the obvious one; see below.**

### What is settled

`radard`'s lead Kalman filter **is** reset across a Bosch-A track-ID reuse, but only because
the object goes absent, never because the identity changed:

- `radar_interface.py` detects the identity change (`life_delta != 2 × frame_delta`), clears
  the incarnation's range history and pops the point. The replacement needs a second coherent
  sample to mature, so the CAN identity is missing from `RadarData` for **exactly one sweep**
  and returns under the **same `trackId`**.
- `RadarD.update` pops a `Track` — and with it the `KF1D` — only when an ID is absent from the
  `liveTracks` it is looking at. **`RadarPoint` carries no incarnation field**, so the parser
  knows the identity changed and `radard` cannot.
- `card.py` publishes `liveTracks` once per sweep (~14.35 Hz); `radard` polls `modelV2` at
  `DT_MDL` (20 Hz) and reads the latest message through `SubMaster`, which keeps no queue.

So the reset is carried by **one message with nothing behind it**. Measured through the real
`RadarD` with both objects at constant velocity (true lead acceleration 0 throughout), losing
that message fabricates ≈ **0.92 m/s² of lead acceleration per m/s of identity step**, peaking
at 0.49 s and taking ~2.2 s to fall under 0.5 m/s²: a 15 m/s step yields ±13.73 m/s². D-042's
comparable 6 m/s step drove a measured −3.51 m/s² brake on `000001f3`.

Both signs are harmful: closing→opening fabricates a departing lead and **suppresses** braking;
opening→closing fabricates an approaching one and **brakes for nothing**.

Tests: `test_civic_bosch_incarnation_gap_resets_lead_kalman` and
`test_civic_bosch_coalesced_incarnation_gap_injects_phantom_lead_accel`. The first fails when
the `Track` pop is removed (D-009 negative control, checked).

### What is NOT settled, and it is the part that matters

All of the above assumes the radar **signals** the reuse. Whether Bosch-A can hand a track ID
to a new object with `life` still advancing by exactly `2 × frame_delta` — a seamless reuse —
is **not established**. If it can, nothing resets: not the parser's range history, not the lead
filter, and there is no absence for anything downstream to notice. That is D-048's "track
migrates onto the wrong scatterer" seen from the identity side, and it needs route evidence.

### Rejected: widening the gap for redundancy

The reflex fix — withhold the replacement for two sweeps instead of one so the absence cannot
be coalesced away — is **rejected outright**. It buys redundancy by deleting a radar point for
longer, which is precisely D-041 and D-042: on `000001f9` a deleted point left the planner
commanding 0.00 while closing on stopped traffic. **Never buy a reset by deleting geometry.**

The direction that does not fight D-041 is to publish the boundary as *information* — an
incarnation counter on `RadarPoint`, so `radard` can reseed the filter on an identity change
while the point keeps being published continuously. That changes a published struct and the
parser/`radard` contract, so it is a design, not a patch.

### Validation gate — do not implement before this is satisfied

1. **How often lifecycle breaks actually occur on real routes**, and whether any of them
   coincide with a hard brake. Zero observed breaks would make this a latent hazard, not a
   live one, and would change the priority.
2. **Whether seamless ID reuse exists at all** (the open question above). It decides whether an
   incarnation counter is sufficient or merely necessary.
3. A negative control per D-009: the corpus replays with **no** change in published leads on
   segments containing no incarnation break.

Until then this is a characterisation, and the repo carries it as one.

## D-050 — The standalone laptop tools target Python 3.9, and lint must not be allowed to break that

**Status:** settled, 2026-09-15. **Evidence:** a user's own run of `tools/konik_preflight.py`.

`tools/konik_login.py`, `tools/plain_http.py` and `tools/konik_preflight.py` exist so that a
route can be checked from a machine where the network works and the tree cannot be built. The
Python they will actually meet there is the macOS Command Line Tools build, which is **3.9** —
older than the 3.11 the rest of this repo targets.

This is not hypothetical. `pyproject.toml` sets ruff `target-version = "py311"`, so `UP017`
rewrote `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` to `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` in the preflight. It
passed lint and every test in the container, and then died on the user's laptop before the
first check ran:

    from datetime import UTC, datetime
    ImportError: cannot import name 'UTC' from 'datetime'

The rule this settles: **the repo's Python target does not apply to these three files.**

1. `UP017` is disabled for them in `pyproject.toml`, with the reason written at the ignore.
2. `tools/lib/tests/test_py39_compat.py` enforces the constraint from two sides — it AST-parses
   each file at `feature_version=(3, 9)` (catching syntax) and greps for a list of runtime names
   that parse fine but do not exist until 3.10/3.11/3.12 (catching imports and attributes).
3. That name list is a **ratchet, not a specification**. It cannot be exhaustive. When a
   too-new name gets through and bites someone, the fix includes adding it to the list.
4. Anything new added to `STANDALONE` in that test takes on the same constraint.

**Known limit, stated per AGENTS.md §4:** there is no 3.9 interpreter in the agent container,
so this is a *static* check. It would not catch a 3.10+ behaviour change in a function that
exists in both versions. The only real verification is a user running the tool on 3.9.

## D-051 — Where the corpus harness and the recorded analysis disagree on a definition, the harness's definition is canonical and both are stated

**Settled 2026-09-15**, when `tools/bosch_a_corpus_report.py` first ran on
`00000231--5782493b00` and was compared against the 6- and 16-segment figures recorded in
`STATUS.md`. Those figures came from code that was never committed, so a disagreement had no
tie-breaker; three of them turned out to be **definitions**, not measurements.

1. **The radar/vision range gap carries `RADAR_TO_CAMERA`.** The harness computes
   `dRel - (lead.x - 1.52)`; the recorded figures computed `lead.x - dRel`. Every recorded gap
   percentile is reproduced to within 0.9–1.7 m by that 1.52 m offset (6 segments, n=4,872 here
   against 4,868 recorded). **The harness's definition wins** because it is the one
   `radard.track_matches_vision` actually applies when deciding whether a track matches a lead —
   a gap statistic that does not match the matcher cannot inform a matcher threshold.
2. **Vision-lead occupancy and residuals are cut at `prob >= 0.5`; the gap distribution at
   `>= 0.9`.** At 0.9, `ed6257ef` (segment 25) reads 1.4% vision-lead occupancy against the
   recorded 94.2%; at 0.5 it reads 94.2% exactly, its lateral residual reproduces at +4.40 m
   (recorded 4.30) and `7b76edd7` (segment 24) at +4.36 (recorded 4.33). Both cuts are now
   reported side by side rather than one being silently chosen.
3. **U11-versus-range-rate pairs use MEASURED points only, inside contiguous runs.** Coasted
   points carry a held velocity, not U11, and differentiating across a dropout or an ID reuse
   manufactures range rates — 55.8 m/s at the extreme. This one does **not** reconcile: the
   harness reports 9.16% of samples disagreeing by more than 5 m/s against a recorded 2.26%, and
   no lag at the cross-correlation peak against a recorded −4 samples. **Neither side wins**; see
   `STATUS.md`.

Rejected: quietly adopting the recorded definition to make the numbers match. The offset and the
probability cut are each a *decision about what the statistic means*, and the recorded analysis
cannot be re-run to defend its choice.

**Consequence for anyone reading older figures:** a gap quoted before this date is ~1.5 m larger
than the same gap quoted after it, and an occupancy quoted before this date is the 0.5 cut.

---

## D-052 — A saturated lifecycle counter is not an identity change; keep publishing the object

**Settled 2026-09-15 from two real drives.** `LIFECYCLE_RAW` is 12 bits and advances by 2 per frame
index, so it pins at **0xFFE (4094) after 2,047 frames — ~137 s of continuous tracking** at the
~14.9 Hz sweep rate, and never advances again. It is **not** the invalid sentinel (0xFFF): STATUS,
range, azimuth and track id all stay valid and the object is still there.

`life_delta == 2 * frame_delta` therefore failed on every subsequent sweep, clearing the range
history and popping the point each time, so no point could ever mature again.

### What that cost, measured

* `00000232--fc8dad0d18`: track 37 saturated at an age of **137.4 s** and was then observed on every
  sweep for **121.8 s (1,815 sweeps) and published on none of them**. Its last published geometry
  was dRel 38.9 m, yRel −0.1 m — the followed lead. Track 34 did the same at 137.5 s.
* `0000020a--1fd2b58eda`: track 38 was suppressed across segments 5→8 (~3.7 min, starting at route
  time 5:05.17) and track 51 across segments 11→12.
* **Corroborated by the device, not only by replay.** On the same CAN, the car (running `0083ffa`,
  without this fix) published id 38 on **0/893, 0/894, 0/893** sweeps of segments 6, 7 and 8, while
  this tree's parser publishes 93.1%, 100.0% and 82.3%. On `00000232` the recorded `liveTracks` drop
  id 37 entirely across segments 10–12 and the radar lead goes 1200/1200 → 0/1200 frames.
* The driver felt it: the 5:05 brake on `0000020a` handed from radar to vision mid-manoeuvre, and
  the 7:43 stop-and-creep ran with no radar lead at all.

### The decision

A counter pinned at its maximum **cannot testify to identity either way**, so it must not be read as
evidence of a new incarnation. `BOSCH_A_LIFE_SATURATED` makes a saturated→saturated step a
continuation. This follows D-041 and D-042: publishing a bounded/uncertain point is safer than
deleting a real object, and the range-innovation gate still judges every sweep while
`_bosch_a_retire_stale_tracks` still retires a genuine disappearance.

Verified after the change: id 37 publishes **1,788/1,815 (98.5%)** over the same window, id 34
180/184, and the five-route lifecycle census reports **zero chronic runs**.

**Rejected:** treating saturation as a death and letting the track re-birth. That is the same
"delete the geometry to buy a reset" move D-049 already rejected, and here it deletes a lead that is
still in front of the car.

### The cost, stated plainly

An ID reuse that happens **while the counter is saturated** is now undetectable at the parser: there
is no counter movement left to break. That narrows D-049's gate item 2 rather than closing it, and
it is the price of not deleting a live lead. A tracked object old enough to saturate has been held
for over two minutes, which makes a reuse at that moment less likely but not impossible.

**Negative control (D-009):** a counter frozen at any non-saturated value is still a lifecycle break
— `test_a_stuck_but_unsaturated_counter_is_still_a_lifecycle_break`.

## D-053 — The range-derived vRel may correct U11, in ONE direction, behind a toggle

**Decided 2026-09-16. TEST feature, default OFF, param `RangeDerivedVrel`, Bosch-A only.
Nothing here is road evidence — this has never run on a car.**

D-044 published `vRelRange` — a 5-sample LSQ of d(dRel)/dt — as shadow telemetry and said nothing
consumes it. This amends that, narrowly: on Bosch-A, with the toggle on, for the lead track only,
the range rate may make the published closing speed **more closing, never less**.

### Why the one direction

Both recorded U11 failure modes understate closing, so correcting in only that direction is the
whole safety argument:

* **The rail.** D-041, route `000001f9` at 29:52: U11 pinned at −13.5 m/s on 88 of 88 active frames
  with healthy u10 while the range closed at −19.4 m/s. D-041 publishes the rail as a **bound** and
  states that recovering the true value past it "needs the range channel and is deliberately left
  to a separate, validated change." This is that change. It is still unvalidated.
* **The lag.** D-043/D-044, routes `000001fe/fb/fd`: U11 detects a closing onset **0.88–1.28 s
  late** while a 4-sample range LSQ lands within **0.07–0.14 s**. On `000001f3` at 19:27 the fitted
  range rate was −6.7 m/s while U11 still read −2.08.

The mirror direction — letting the range say a lead is closing **less** than U11 claims — is
refused outright. That would release braking on a range channel that the branch has already
recorded being wrong, and it is the same asymmetry D-043 settled for the parser's consistency
check. An understated closing rate still brakes; an overstated one does not.

### What bounds it

Constants and their evidence live in the `RANGE_VREL_ASSIST_*` block in
`selfdrive/controls/radard.py`. In short: 2.0 m/s of sustained disagreement, held for 5 consecutive
**measured** updates (0.35 s, against a 0.88–1.28 s lag), correction capped at 8.0 m/s, and geometry
gated to dRel ≥ 8 m with |yRel| ≤ 1.5 m — an azimuth bound of 10.8°, where reading a radial rate as
a longitudinal one costs at most 1.8%.

Every rejection path clears the correction outright, so the fallback is always the shipped U11
behaviour and never a half-applied correction.

### A duplicate radard cycle is not a coast, and must hold rather than clear

`RadarD` runs at the 20 Hz model rate over a 14.35 Hz radar and collapses two different conditions
into one bit — `measured = pt.measured and radar_fresh` — so `Track.update` sees
`measurement_update = False` for both of these:

* **A duplicate cycle.** No new `liveTracks` message arrived, so `t_now` has not advanced,
  `dRel`/`yRel`/`vRel` are last cycle's values, the range history is not appended to and the lead
  KF is not stepped. Roughly one cycle in four. Nothing was re-measured, so there is nothing to
  re-decide: **hold**.
* **A coast.** A new message *did* arrive, with the parser's measured bit clear. `t_now` advances.
  **Clear** — see rejected alternative 6.

Clearing on both — which is what the first implementation did — resets the arm count roughly every
fourth cycle, so `RANGE_VREL_ASSIST_ARM_UPDATES` consecutive qualifying fits are unreachable and
the feature is **permanently inert on a car**, while every unit test that feeds one update per
radar sweep still passes. It was caught by reading the call site, not by the tests. The two are
now separated by whether `t_now` advanced, which needs no tuned constant;
`TestRadardLoopCadence` drives the real 20-Hz-over-14.35-Hz interleave and
`test_clearing_on_a_duplicate_cycle_makes_the_assist_permanently_inert` is the D-009 control that
reproduces the defect. If the call site is ever given separate bits for the two conditions, split
on those bits — the clock comparison is standing in for information `RadarD` discarded.

### The hazard, stated plainly

**This is a velocity check that reads the range channel, so a RANGE error is invisible to it.**
STATUS.md's t≈11 s false brake on `00000231--5782493b00` is exactly a range error: track 6 walked
71.8 → 61.6 m while vision held 75–78 m at prob 0.93–1.00 and the real gap grew. U11 (−6.02) and
the range fit (−4.5 to −6.4) **agreed with each other** throughout. STATUS.md already records that
the shadow channel is blind to this, and so is this assist.

`[INFERRED from the recorded figures, not replayed]` on those numbers the worst disagreement is
**+0.38 m/s against a 2.0 m/s threshold**, so the assist stays inert there — a 1.62 m/s margin.
That margin is the only thing standing between this feature and amplifying the one false brake
this branch has recorded. `TestTheRangeWalkFault` in
`selfdrive/controls/tests/test_range_vrel_assist.py` pins it. Do not "fix" that test.

### Rejected alternatives

1. **A symmetric correction.** See above: it releases braking on an unverified channel.
2. **Feeding it into track selection.** `track_matches_vision` and `vision_track_probability` keep
   scoring the **native** `self.vRel`/`self.vLead`; only `get_RadarState` and the lead KF see the
   correction. This changes what is reported *about* the chosen lead, never *which* track is
   chosen. Association is a separate problem with its own recorded failures (D-048, D-049) and
   folding an unvalidated velocity into it would make both harder to diagnose.
3. **Applying it to every track.** Restricted to `RadarD.prev_lead_track_ids`. Adjacent-lane tracks
   sit at 17–23° azimuth where a range derivative is not a longitudinal velocity at all, and the
   adjacent-lane stopped-vehicle detector reads `self.vRel` directly.
4. **Changing the capnp schema** to publish the native U11 alongside the corrected value. Not
   needed: the native `vRel` for the same track is already recoverable from `liveTracks` by
   matching `rr.points[].trackId` against `radarTrackId`, so the comparison stays fully auditable
   in a log. A schema change would mean regenerating `libcereal.a` and `cereal/gen/cpp` for a
   field that is derivable.
5. **Non-Bosch-A radars.** The evidence base is entirely Bosch-A U11. Nidec and Bosch-B have
   neither the rail nor the measured lag, and `RadarD` does not read the param at all on them.
6. **Holding the correction across a coast.** A Bosch-A coast holds `last_trusted_vrel` and is
   **not** bounded by `BOSCH_A_STALE_S` — every coast path refreshes `last_seen_nanos`, and D-052
   measured 121.8 s of continuous suppression of a followed lead. Holding a correction across that
   is unbounded staleness, so a coast clears it.
7. **Enabling by default.** It has never run on a car.

### The toggle rides the far-lead brake limit's gate, on all three surfaces

`RangeDerivedVrel` is exposed exactly where `FarLeadBrakeLimit` is: adjacent to it in
`device_settings_layout.json` under `parent_key: AdvancedLongitudinalTune` with
`settings_tier: advanced` and `requires_offroad: true`, adjacent to it in the raylib
`_bosch_a_radar_rows`, and behind the same `BoschARadarAvailable` check in Galaxy.

Galaxy's check was a hand-written `param.key === "FarLeadBrakeLimit"` branch. It is now a set,
`BOSCH_A_REQUIRED_KEYS`. **Rejected: leaving the new row ungated in Galaxy.** A row that renders on
a car whose radar cannot feed the feature is an invitation to switch on something inert and then
report that it "did nothing" — the same class of confusion open item 4 cost a day to unpick. Both
rows are Bosch-A-only TEST features acting on the same radar lead; they get one gate, not two.

**Rejected: a per-key `requires_capability` field in the layout JSON instead.** That mechanism
already exists and would be more general, but `FarLeadBrakeLimit` does not use it, and the point
of this change is that the two rows behave identically. Converting both is a separate change with
its own blast radius across every other consumer of the layout.

Pinned by `test_bosch_a_test_toggles_share_one_galaxy_location_and_gate`, which asserts the two
keys agree on all three surfaces at once, and is negative-controlled both ways (D-009).

### Known asymmetry during a coast

The lead KF is only stepped on a measurement update, so across a coast `aLeadK` stays frozen at its
corrected value while the published `vLead` reverts to native. Both are bounded, and both sit on
the conservative side (`aLeadK` more negative, `vLead` back to shipped behaviour), but they are
briefly inconsistent with each other. Recorded here rather than papered over.

**Negative control (D-009):** `TestNegativeControlOfTheTestsThemselves` breaks the arm count, the
disagreement threshold, the lateral gate and the duplicate-cycle hold in turn and asserts each
guarded property actually fails — including that lowering `MIN_DISAGREEMENT` makes the t≈11 s
fault fire, and that clearing on a duplicate cycle makes the assist unable to arm at all.

### Revision 2026-09-16 — reworked after replay; the KF no longer sees the correction

`[REPLAY, open loop — not road evidence]` The version above was replayed through the real
`radard.Track` on 232/236/237/239/23a. It helped on real rail and onset closings but fired on two
recorded range faults (the `00000232` 3:02.8 range walk and the `00000236` 22:13.6 new-track
settle, which hit the 8.0 cap), and because the corrected vLead fed the lead KF, `aLeadK` dipped by
as much as −7.2 m/s² on replay. Same toggle, same one-sided contract, now also:

- **Two fits must agree.** A 15-sample (~1 s) long range fit and the 5-sample fit must both show
  ≥2.0 m/s more closing for `ARM_UPDATES = 5` consecutive updates. At 4, the 232 walk leaks
  1.0 m/s·s and the 236 settle 0.4 — **both recorded phantoms are refused by ONE update**.
- **Clear-only guards** (they can drop a correction, never create one): long-fit residual ≤0.6 m,
  long-fit span 0.6–1.5 s, ego ≥5 m/s, and no correction that would read the lead as driving
  backwards by >5 m/s. The correction never takes the lead below 0 m/s.
- **Rail rule:** on the U11 −13.5 m/s low rail the short fit is not needed; the long fit decides.
- **The lead KF stays on native U11.** Only the published `vLead`/`vRel` is corrected, so `aLeadK`
  is unchanged by construction (100% equal on 239/23a replay). This removes the known asymmetry
  recorded above.

Cost: onset latency 0.77 s from a closing kink to first correction (0.42 s before), against a U11
onset lag of 0.88–1.28 s. Replay gain and activity per route are in STATUS.md. The t≈11 s blind
spot (range error that U11 agrees with) is unchanged.

## D-054 — A range is range-rejected only if it contradicts BOTH the last accepted sample and the last gated range

**Decided 2026-09-17. Implemented in `radar_interface.py` (`_BoschATrackState.range_anchor`,
`_bosch_a_range_innovation_rejected`). Replay and static evidence only; never run on a car.**

**The lockout.** Before this, the range-innovation gate measured every sweep against the last
ACCEPTED sample. A velocity coast (D-043 rate check, high u10, U11 and ratio unavailable) publishes
the range but appends no sample, so that baseline froze while the range kept moving. Every later
sweep was predicted across the growing gap with the U11 the coast had just distrusted. The error grew
until the gate rejected, and after `BOSCH_A_STALE_S` the point was deleted. 00000232 track 43 is the
followed lead pulling away 78.5 → 84.5 m. Four coasts grew the error 0.86 / 1.12 / 1.53 / 1.87 / 2.11 m,
and the degraded 2.0 m limit rejected it. Radar then lost the lead for 14.7 s while it closed from
84 m to 27 m. Drift from a coast, not a range step, started 57–78 % of unpublished held sweeps on four
of the five routes, and 656 of 671 held sweeps on the lead. No ≥ 5 m step ever involved the lead.
The earlier wording "never re-admitted" was overstated: about 30 % of lock episodes ended published.

**The rule.** `range_anchor` is the (time, range) of the last observation that passed the gate,
accepted or coasted. A sweep is rejected only if it fails the unchanged residual test (U11
extrapolation or the 00CA ratio, `HARD_MAX` 5.0 m, 2.0 m when degraded) against **both** the anchor
and the last accepted sample. `samples`, the velocity history, stay accepted-only. A rejected range
moves neither baseline. A coast advances the anchor only when an anchor already exists, and the first
accepted sample roots it. A lifecycle break clears it. The rejection hold's freshness is timed from
the anchor.

**Why both baselines.** Replay found two drafts wrong before this one:
1. *The anchor advanced on every coast.* A high-u10 BIRTH coast rooted the gate on a range that was
   never checked or published. On 00000239 this withheld 2,236 sweeps the old parser published.
2. *The anchor alone was the baseline.* 00000237 track 12 is a new object whose range walked out
   25.4 → 28.06 m while U11 said −2 m/s. The rate check rightly coasted the walk and the walk became
   the anchor. The real ranges (25.3 m closing to 17 m) were then rejected for 52.8 s, while the old
   parser, measuring against the accepted sample, tracked them. This is the mirror of 232 track 43:
   there U11 lagged and the range was right; here the range walked and U11 was right. Each baseline
   alone locks one of them out.

**Replay `[REPLAY]`** through one continuous real `RadarInterface` per route, old parser → this one,
on 232 / 236 / 237 / 239 / 23a:

| | 232 | 236 | 237 | 239 | 23a |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| published % of valid object sweeps | 85.3 → 89.8 | 83.0 → 87.2 | 73.6 → 80.2 | 83.3 → 86.5 | 75.2 → 77.1 |
| locked object-time % | 6.5 → 1.9 | 7.3 → 3.2 | 14.1 → 7.4 | 6.7 → 3.6 | 9.6 → 7.8 |
| followed lead lost ≥ 1 s (episodes / s) | 8 / 41 → 2 / 5 | 8 / 77 → 3 / 26 | 9 / 105 → 4 / 42 | 1 / 4 → 0 | 2 / 2 → 0 |
| sweeps published only by old / only by new | 0 / 1,931 | 16 / 4,024 | 88 / 3,227 | 54 / 1,173 | 10 / 422 |

Every remaining lead-lost episode also exists in the old parser, at the same length or shorter
(232 track 43: 14.7 → 4.0 s; 237 track 9: 39.9 → 21.2 s). No run of sweeps that only the old parser
published is a lead-lost episode in the census. The longest run is 237 track 36: 5.2 s at 110 m, |y| 3.1 m.
Its range walked 109.6 → 117.1 m over ~3 s against a closing U11, one walked range was accepted, and
the snap back to 111.7 m then contradicted both baselines.

**Negative controls (static, `test_bosch_a_radar.py::TestCoastAdvancesTheRangeGate`).** The recorded
reset shape after a coast never publishes and never enters either baseline. A persistent +8 m step
is still rejected.
- Against the old parser: the 232 lockout, hold and anchor tests fail, and the 237 walk test passes.
- Against the anchor-only draft: only the 237 walk test fails.
- Against the first draft: the walk and the birth-coast tests fail.

**Residuals, investigated 2026-09-17. Replay and static only; nothing below is on this branch.**
Prototypes are on `archive/proposal/d054-residuals` (not for the car). Replay covered 00000232, 00000236,
00000237, 00000239 and 0000023a on the D-054 parser.
- *Ratio vRel timed from the last accepted sample:* no effect in replay. 0 published vRel values
  were ratio-sourced. No change proposed.
- *Lead-lost time with D-054:* 9 episodes. The D-043 rate check dominated 32.3 s of them and range
  rejection dominated 50.3 s. That led to three causes: D-055, D-056 and D-057.
- *Rejection-run census* (558 runs, D-054+D-055+D-056 parser):
  - **Returned** runs (the range came back to the old track), 13 of ≥3 sweeps: all ≤1.2 s and all
    degraded (existence 0 on 62–83% of sweeps, U11 railed at −13.5 m/s). Rejecting these is correct.
  - **Joined** runs (the anchor's U11 extrapolation eventually meets the real range), 79: 7 lead
    runs totalling 74.4 s (236 track 38, 27.4 s; 236 track 21, 20.4 s, fully degraded; 237 track 31,
    20.4 s; 237 track 36, 12.9 s).
  - **Unresolved** (the track ends still rejected), 341: 3 lead runs totalling 21.3 s.
  - A join publishes whether or not the range agrees with U11. That is existing behaviour, and it
    is how a stale anchor ends a lockout today.

## D-055 — an invalid slot must not hide an identity that is valid in another slot this sweep

**Status: on the car branch 2026-09-17 (replay and static only; no road evidence yet).** Promoted
after the two fresh routes driven on D-054 (`0756f810`) were replayed: 0000023b / 0000023e show
**0 lost point-sweeps (0 lead)**, 9 + 331 restored (33 lead on 23e), every one a coast
(measured=False), so no new measured vRel reaches control and the future-slope metric is unchanged.
The lock census on those routes (same parser the car ran): 23b 76 locked sweeps (1.3 %), 23e 2,933
(3.8 %), and **0 episodes ≥1 s with the device lead vision-matched to the locked object** on either.
The collapse loop hid the previous occupant id of any slot that turned invalid, even when that id
had just migrated to another valid slot. A coasted point then vanished while its object was still
reported.
- **Change:** the ids valid in this sweep are excluded from the hide set.
- **Static:** 4 tests. The 2 coasted-migration tests fail on D-054; the negative control (an id
  seen nowhere else is still hidden) passes on both.
- **Replay vs D-054:** 0 lost point-sweeps on all 5 routes. 2,252 point-sweeps restored, 504 of
  them lead, and every one is measured=False (a coast, carrying stale vRel). It fully restores 232
  track 43 (4.0 s), 237 track 47 (4.6 s) and 237 track 9 (21.2 s).
- **Recommendation:** the strongest candidate for the car after the fresh routes on 0756f810.

## D-056 — REJECTED IN REPLAY: fit the D-043 rate check over gated ranges

**Status: prototype only. Do not ship.**
The idea: the rate check fits `samples` (accepted only), which go stale during coasts; fit gated
ranges instead.
- **Static:** 2 tests pass.
- **Replay vs D-055:**
  - The re-admitted measured vRel disagrees with the next-1 s range slope far more than reference
    points do. >3 m/s over-close is 18–21% of new points, against 3–6% for reference.
  - p90 error is 4.9–6.4 m/s, against a reference of 3.0–5.7 m/s.
  - 0000023a loses 73 point-sweeps, 14 of them lead.
- **Why it fails:** D-043 was catching real U11 over-closing that the stale-history fit happened
  to flag. The fresh fit follows the range and lets the U11 claim through.
- **Next step:** any retry must be judged by that future-slope metric, not by lost/gained counts.

## D-057 — a lasting, clean, U11-consistent rejected step re-anchors the gate

**Status: on the car branch 2026-09-17, re-based onto D-055 alone (no `gated_ranges`; `samples` and the anchor re-root on the run's last 3 sweeps). Replay and static only; no road evidence yet.**
- **Replay vs D-055 (`ab5.py`, 2026-09-17), all seven routes 232/236/237/239/23a/23b/23e:** lost 0 and
  0 measured/unmeasured flips everywhere. Gained point-sweeps: 232 9, 236 607 (198 lead), 237 1,027
  (181 lead), 239 0, 23a 266, 23b 0, 23e 13. 236 track 38 restored 17.1 s, 237 track 31 16.2 s,
  237 track 63 51.4 s (item 22.4, non-lead, 23→20 m at ≈0 m/s). Re-admitted measured vRel vs the
  next-1 s slope: p90 2.2 / 1.1 / 2.4 m/s and >3 m/s over-close 2.2 / 2.2 / 0 % (236 / 237 / 23a)
  against reference 5.4 / 5.9 / 2.6 %. Unlike D-055 this DOES put new measured vRel into control.
- Earlier prototype record (stacked on D-056) follows.
- **Change:** a rejection run re-roots samples and anchor on its last 3 sweeps when all of these
  hold:
  - it has ≥8 sweeps and spans ≥1.5 s;
  - its last 8 sweeps are non-degraded with U11;
  - a line fit has rms ≤1 m;
  - its slope is within 3 m/s of median U11.
  Constants: `BOSCH_A_REANCHOR_MIN_SPAN_S`, `_WINDOW`, `_MAX_RMS_M`.
- **Why 1.5 s:** every returned run in the census was ≤1.2 s and degraded.
- **Static:** 4 tests.
  - The positive test publishes within 1.5–1.65 s, and fails without D-057.
  - The degraded (sigma 7; existence 0) and U11-contradicting controls never re-anchor.
  - The contradiction control needs a 25 m step: with 8.5 m the existing join publishes first.
- **Replay vs D-056:**
  - 0 lost and 0 measured/unmeasured flips on all 5 routes.
  - New measured point-sweeps: 236 602 (198 lead), 237 1,015 (181 lead), 23a 266.
  - 232 gained 9 point-sweeps; 239 is unchanged.
  - 236 track 38 is restored for 17.1 s and 237 track 31 for 16.2 s.
  - Newly measured vRel vs the next-1 s slope is as good as or better than reference: p90 2.2 / 1.0
    / 2.4 m/s, and >3 m/s over-close is 2.2% / 2.2% / 0%.
- **Limits:**
  - 236 track 21 (20.4 s) is fully degraded, and D-057 does not touch it by design.
  - Onset-to-re-anchor was about 10 s on 236_38, so its tail was degraded for a while.
- **Next step (done 2026-09-17):** re-based onto D-055 without D-056 and replayed; see status above.

## D-058 — BLoTv3: the t_follow pads saturate rather than vanish, and the crawl hold latches on necessity, not on the exact floor

**Decided 2026-09-17. Experimental. Implemented in `selfdrive/controls/lib/blotv3.py`. Ported from
upstream BLoTv3 (`SpysyWeeb/Spysypilot`, branch `combo-blotv3`, `necessity_supervisor.py` at
`7aed876`, design note `docs/BLoTv3.md` §3). With these fixes in, the supervisor, its module, its
class and its toggle were renamed from BLoTv2 to BLoTv3 (`BlotV2` → `BlotV3`; the stored toggle
does not carry over and starts off). Unit evidence.** (Numbered D-058 because D-055 was taken by the
radar residual proposal that landed in parallel.)

Our supervisor was a port of upstream BLoTv2 (b38e933 closed five gaps against it). Upstream has
since restructured BLoTv2 into BLoTv3, which is mostly a module split we do not want: BLoTv3 moves
stop handling into `force_stops.py`, mode selection into `conditional_experimental_mode.py`, and
model-lead anchoring into `longitudinal_lead.py`, none of which we have or consume. Two items in
that restructure are **behavioral fixes to the supervisor itself**, and those are what this entry
adopts. The rest is deliberately not ported; see the closing list.

**1. The pads no longer vanish above `ONSET_MAX_A_REQ`.** Both following-time pads were gated on
`required_decel < ONSET_MAX_A_REQ` (1.5 m/s²). That constant's real job is the emergency bypass,
which additionally needs `TTC < MIN_TTC` **and** a real braking shortfall. So whenever need rose
past 1.5 m/s² without those two also holding — a hard-braking lead still 4 s away, or a stopped
lead the MPC is already braking adequately for — the pad collapsed from its ceiling to zero in one
frame, i.e. the obstacle cost tightened exactly where need was highest. The ratio terms
(`-onset_lead_accel / ONSET_FULL_DECEL`, `required_decel / 1.2`) are already `min(..., 1.0)`, so
dropping the upper gate makes the pads saturate at 0.45 s and 0.75 s instead. Nothing here
publishes acceleration; the widest outcome is following further back.

**2. The crawl hold latches on "was necessity-braking", not on `jerk_scale == JERK_SCALE_MIN`.**
The hold that carries softening through the `v_ego <= MIN_SPEED` transition only fired when
`jerk_scale` sat *exactly* at its floor. A partially softened approach — a pad with no trigger
armed, or a slew still in flight when `v_ego` crossed `MIN_SPEED` — was not held, so the jerk cost
stiffened back toward 1.0 in the last metres of the stop, which is the ratchet the hold exists to
prevent. The hold now keys off a `_responsive` latch (set by any in-motion frame that softened the
scale or raised a pad) and clamps with `min(scale_target, self.jerk_scale)`.

**Both release paths are explicit, because a latch that cannot clear is the dangerous shape here.**
The emergency bypass clears `_responsive` in the same frame it fires, so the one case that wants the
stock jerk cost gets it. Lead loss clears it, so a re-acquired lead inherits no softening from a
vehicle that is gone. Each clearing path has a test that fails when that line is removed (D-009).

**Rejected alternative: port BLoTv3 wholesale.** BLoTv3's value is its module boundaries, and those
boundaries assume BLoTv3's own stop machinery, CEM, and model-lead anchor. Adopting them here would
replace StarPilot's lead selection and stop handling with an unvalidated upstream design in one
commit. The two fixes above are separable and stand on their own.

**Not ported, and why:**
- `force_stops.py`, `stop_helpers.py`, `conditional_experimental_mode.py` (D13–D21 upstream) — a
  stop/commitment architecture we have no equivalent of. Separate decision if ever wanted.
- `LeadDeparturePreRelease` and `model_predicted_speed()` — upstream Smooth Stops, still nothing to
  wire them into (unchanged from b38e933).
- `MODEL_LEAD_STATIONARY_NOISE` (0.2 m/s) — fixes upstream's `anchor_model_lead`, whose strict
  `vLead >= 0` gate dropped the anchor through lead launches. Our `model_predicted_acceleration`
  has no such gate, so there is no equivalent defect to fix here.
- The `emergency` → `stand_down` rename and BLoTv3's `LongitudinalPolicy` shape (pad instead of
  absolute `t_follow`). Naming, not behavior; renaming would churn the planner's call site without
  changing a frame. Our `emergency` field already reaches no alert, which is upstream's D7.
- BLoTv3's MPC/planner ownership rules (single `set_weights`, `a_prev` refill on obstacle handoff,
  removal of the third model lead, no turn budget). These are `long_mpc.py`/`longitudinal_planner.py`
  decisions in a file StarPilot has diverged from heavily; they are not supervisor behavior.

**What this is not.** Unit tests plus a supervisor-only rlog replay (2026-09-17, STATUS item 24:
jerk scale identical on every engaged lead frame of seven routes; the pad differs for 90 s in 68
hard-braking runs, and also for 1.1 s during the 239 phantom brake), on an experimental supervisor
gated behind the `BlotV3` toggle. Both changes widen following distance or keep the jerk
cost softer for longer; neither deletes a radar point or commands acceleration.

**Part 1 reverted 2026-09-28 (owner request).** The pads again apply only below
`ONSET_MAX_A_REQ` and slew back out above it. The premise above was wrong: a pad asks the MPC for
*more* following distance, so a pad held while the car already needs a hard brake makes that brake
harder, not softer. Evidence (closed-loop replay sim, not driven): route 00000294 6:25, an
owner-bookmarked bad brake (a real lead braked about -5 m/s² and then turned off at 35 m), peaked
at -4.23 with BLoTv3 on, -3.54 off and -3.90 after the revert. Across 8 hard brakes on 00000293 and
00000294, BLoTv3 on braked harder than off in every one (by 0.03-0.8 m/s²) and kept the same closest
gap within about 1 m. After the revert the gap to BLoTv3-off is 0.0-0.57 m/s², and the closest gap
moves by at most 0.9 m (293 6:54: 7.8 -> 7.4 m, off 8.8). What is left of the gap to off comes from
the model-trigger jerk softening, which is BLoTv2's original design and not reverted here. Part 2
(the crawl hold) is unchanged.

## D-059 — a join publishes measured vRel only after a fresh post-join rate fit agrees

**Status:** on the car branch 2026-09-17, replay and static only. Closes STATUS item 22.5.

**Problem.** A *join* is when the D-054 range gate passes again after a rejection run, because the
stale anchor's U11 extrapolation happens to meet the range. The D-043 rate check then fits `samples`
that straddle the gap (pre-gap ranges plus the joined range), so the gap sets the rate and a U11
that contradicts the joined range is not caught. Join census over 232/236/237/239/23a/23b/23e
(`an2/joinscan.py`): 210 joins, 9 on the lead. Measured vRel within 1 s after a join over-closes the
next-1 s range slope by >3 m/s on 21.0 % of sweeps (33.1 % when the run slope contradicts U11,
n=59) vs 4.6 % for all measured points (n=4,740). Static probe on a8370b3b: an 8.5 m step held still
with U11 −4 joins at 0.84 s and publishes measured −4.0 m/s, then coasts holding −4.0 as trusted.

**Decision.** At a join the track starts `rejoin_samples`. Until a one-sided D-043-style fit over
the last `BOSCH_A_REANCHOR_WINDOW` post-join ranges (same min-samples, min-span and 3 m/s
constants) agrees with vRel, the point is published unmeasured on its last trusted vRel, and a point
the rejection had popped is re-created (D-041/D-042: publish degraded, do not delete). `samples` is
left untouched, so the change can only withdraw measured vRel, never admit it.

**Rejected: J1, clearing `samples` at a join.** Replay (`an2/ab6.py`): 106 newly measured sweeps
over-closing on 16.0 % (236: 12/14) and 65 non-lead point-sweeps lost — the D-056 failure mode.

**Replay, J2 (shipped) vs the car branch** (`an2/ab7.py`): lost 0 and new measured 0 on every route;
gained 1 (236); 612 point-sweeps flip to unmeasured, 30 on the lead (236 12, 237 8, 23e 10). The
withdrawn measured vRel over-closed on 29.2 % (105/359 scored) vs reference 4.6 %. **Caveat:** it
also under-closed by >3 m/s on 18 % (65/359) vs reference 8.6 % — some withdrawn values were
lagging rather than over-closing, and now coast on the last trusted vRel instead.

**Road check.** Not road-validated. On the next drive: the lead lock census, any brake event within
1 s of a join, and how long lead points sit in the unmeasured rejoin hold.


## D-060 — REMOVED: the far-lead brake limit is inert on the fault it was written for

**Decision.** `FarLeadBrakeLimit` and every `FAR_LEAD_BRAKE_LIMIT_*` constant are removed from the
tree: the planner method pair, the call site, the param key, the raylib row, the Galaxy layout entry
and its Bosch-A key set, and the feature's own test file. The driver's decision that it ships default
OFF (D-053-era) is superseded — there is nothing left to switch on. This is not a re-tune and it must
not be reintroduced as one.

**Why.** Measured through the real `LongitudinalPlanner` on rlog-fed replay (STATUS item 37), the cap
forced ON differs from the cap OFF on **0 cycles in every window measured** — four windows, ~3900
planner cycles, including both of the worst far-lead hard brakes in the fleet (90 m leads reaching
`ACCEL_MIN` −3.50). It never engaged once.

The mechanism is structural, not a threshold that was set badly. `get_far_lead_brake_limit` computed
`ttc = dRel / closing` and returned `None` when `ttc < FAR_LEAD_BRAKE_LIMIT_MIN_TTC = 10.0`. The
false brakes this feature exists for are caused by the Bosch-A U11 saturation rail (item 34,
`b73dc693`), where `vRel` publishes exactly −13.50 m/s; at 90 m that reads TTC 6.7 s, so the cap
stood itself down on precisely the frames it was meant to bound. **The rail that causes the fault is
what makes the cap blind to it.** The only leads it could ever fire on are leads whose `vRel` is not
railed, i.e. genuine closers — which is why its record was one good cap against six bad ones.

**Why not raise `MIN_TTC`.** To see a railed lead the threshold would have to sit below the rail's
own TTC, which at realistic ranges is 3–7 s. A floor of −2.0 m/s² applied to every lead inside 7 s of
collision is a cap on real emergency braking. That is a worse failure than the one being fixed, and
it is the reason this is a removal and not a constant change. The known ramp-anchor defect documented
in the old evidence block is moot and is not carried forward.

**Limited road evidence, consistent but not confirming.** Routes 245, 246 and 248 ran with the cap
off (`initData`), and the driver reports the last two drives did not over-react. That is consistent
with the cap being inert; it is not evidence the cap ever helped.

**What this does not settle.** Removing the cap does not address the false brake itself. The fault is
lead *selection* — a railed off-path radar track published as a lead — and the replacement must act
there. See STATUS item 37 for why the `dyPath` deletion gate is not that replacement: on 23e it
turned a −1.55 brake into −3.50 by dropping a valid 36 m radar lead and falling through to a nearer,
faster-closing vision lead. Per D-041, the replacement must publish a **bound**, not delete a point,
and it must cover **both** published lead slots, because `LongitudinalMpc` takes `min()` over both.
That replacement is designed as **D-061**, which is proposed and not implemented.

## D-061 — PROPOSED: the dyPath replacement bounds the obstacle in the planner, and never touches selection
**Proposed 2026-09-21 from replay through the real `LongitudinalPlanner` (STATUS item 37). NOT
IMPLEMENTED — the prerequisite in "What does not exist yet" and the acceptance gates at the end both
come before any tune is written.**

### The failure this addresses

D-060 removed `FarLeadBrakeLimit` and recorded that the false brake is a lead *selection* fault: a
railed off-path radar track published as a lead. The obvious fix — reject the radar lead when
`|dyPath| >= 2.5` while vision holds an on-path lead — was scored through the real planner and
**made things worse where it mattered**. On 23e 1783–1792 s it turned a −1.55 m/s² brake into −3.50,
2.32 m/s² worse, with time below −2.5 rising 2.35 → 2.90 s.

The mechanism is recorded in item 37 and is the whole reason for this decision: the gate dropped
radar tid 25 at `dRel` 36.0 / `vRel` −2.30, which cleared `prev_lead_track_ids[i]`, which handed the
slot to a **vision** lead at `dRel` 33.4 / `vRel` −4.51 — nearer and closing twice as fast. It fired
on **1 cycle** and produced **11** divergent cycles, because the handoff outlived the condition that
caused it. This is D-041 measured rather than argued: deleting a radar point bought a harder brake.

### The decision

Keep the `dyPath` signal and throw away the gate. The replacement **bounds the obstacle in the
planner** and leaves `radarState` untouched:

> The lead is published exactly as measured, keeps its slot, and stays in `prev_lead_track_ids`.
> Attenuation happens downstream, on the per-slot obstacle. **No selection change means no handoff,
> and no handoff means the 23e mechanism cannot occur.**

Four clauses, all load-bearing:

1. **Ramp, not a step.** `offpath` is a scalar in [0,1]: zero below `|dyPath| = 2.5`, one at 3.5,
   linear between. The 2.5 floor is unchanged and is **empirical, not round** — 245 tid 29 peaks at
   2.22 and is a correct brake (item 35). Do not set it lower. The ramp also removes the cliff where
   one cycle's classification dictates the next second of behaviour, which is what turned 1 gated
   cycle into 11 on 23e. This is D-048's "blended, never switched" applied to path geometry.

2. **Vision corroboration, unchanged from item 35.** Attenuate only where vision holds its own
   on-path lead: `|dyPath_ml| < 1.5` and `mlProb >= 0.5`. Where vision disagrees, nothing happens.
   This clause is why roughly half of all off-path radar leads — the ones with no fallback at all —
   are left completely alone, and it is why the census scored *leads lost* rather than leads
   rejected. It is not decoration.

3. **Non-escalation clamp. This is the new clause and the one 23e demands.** Build `x_obstacles`
   twice, unattenuated and attenuated, and require

       min(x_obstacles_bounded[0]) >= min(x_obstacles_raw[0])

   Attenuation may only move the binding obstacle *farther*. If softening a slot would let a nearer
   column win — the other lead, cruise, or a vision lead already holding the other slot — the clamp
   yields exactly zero effect for that cycle. On 23e the fall-through is nearer, so the clamp zeroes
   it **by construction**: that episode becomes structurally untouched rather than luckily untouched,
   and the property is assertable in a unit test instead of re-measured on every tune change.

4. **A floor on the attenuation — the bound is itself bounded.** Without this, clause 3 still permits
   softening all the way out to cruise, which is deletion wearing a different hat. The off-path lead
   keeps authority down to `OFFPATH_ACCEL_FLOOR` (start at **−1.5 m/s²**) and loses only the span
   between that and `ACCEL_MIN`. Express the floor as a distance through the MPC's own algebra
   (`get_safe_obstacle_distance`, `get_stopped_equivalence_factor`) and apply it as a `max` against
   the obstacle, so the solver stays in charge and the result is a bound rather than an offset.

**What this buys, stated honestly.** Variant C (gate on both slots) cut time below −2.5 on 245
234–243 s from 2.30 s to 1.00 s while still reaching −3.50. A bound should land in that
neighbourhood. **It shortens the false brake; it does not prevent it**, and it must not be described
as prevention. The residual — 245 tid 29 at `|dyPath|` 2.22 — sits below the floor by design.

### Amendment to D-048, on new evidence

D-048 clause 3 requires that "any genuinely urgent geometry — small range, short TTC — **bypasses the
bound entirely**." **The TTC half of that is withdrawn for Bosch-A, and must not be written into this
or any Bosch-A bound.** It is the D-060 trap exactly: on the U11 saturation rail `closing` is pinned
at 13.5 m/s, so a railed off-path return at 80 m reads TTC ~6 s — "urgent" — and a TTC bypass would
therefore disable the bound on precisely the railed off-path leads it exists for, the same way
`FAR_LEAD_BRAKE_LIMIT_MIN_TTC = 10.0` disabled the cap on the far-lead brakes it was written for.
**On this platform, a TTC threshold reads the rail and not the road.**

Two replacements, and this decision takes both:

- **Gate on range and lateral geometry, not TTC.** Neither channel is corrupted by the rail.
- **Where `vRelRangeDerived` is finite, use it for closing** rather than the railed `vRel`.
  `RangeDerivedVrel` is the surviving Bosch-A toggle after `1434176b` and the only channel that sees
  past the rail (D-044, D-053). Where it is NaN, fall back to clause 3, which needs no closing
  estimate at all.

**Standing rule from this:** any TTC or closing-speed term added anywhere on this platform must state
in its comment block which channel it reads and what it does when that channel is railed. Two
features have now been lost to the unstated version of that question.

The rest of D-048 stands and is not relitigated. The two decisions bound different axes at different
layers: D-048 bounds a track's authority on **corroboration** inside `radard`, D-061 bounds a slot's
obstacle on **path geometry** inside the planner. They compose; neither subsumes the other.

### Where it lives, and why not in radard

| Piece | Location |
|---|---|
| `dyPath` / `dyPath_ml` per slot | `longitudinal_planner.py`, near the existing `scene_v_ego` block |
| `offpath` ramp, corroboration, floor → per-slot bias | new `get_offpath_lead_obstacle_bound()` in `longitudinal_vehicle_tunes.py`, shaped like `get_honda_crv_5g_stopped_lead_obstacle_bias` |
| Combining with the existing tune biases | `longitudinal_planner.py`, the `stopped_lead_obstacle_bias` block |
| Non-escalation clamp | `long_mpc.py`, immediately after the `lead_*_obstacle` construction |

D-048 argued its layer belongs in `radard` because the corroborating signal is vision and the parser
cannot see `modelV2`. That argument is satisfied by the planner too, and two things force this one
higher: the clamp of clause 3 needs `cruise_obstacle` and **both** slots' obstacle columns, which
exist only in `LongitudinalMpc.update`; and 23e is a direct demonstration that anything acting on
selection inside `radard` can trigger a handoff whose cost exceeds the fault.

Existing plumbing carries it: `LongitudinalMpc.update` already takes `lead_obstacle_bias=(0.0, 0.0)`
per slot. **Note the sign** — the MPC computes `lead_i_obstacle -= bias`, so pushing an obstacle out
requires a **negative** bias, and every existing caller passes positive values only. The clause 3
clamp is what keeps a negative one honest.

New telemetry is not optional: per-slot `dyPathBound` (metres applied) and `dyPathBoundActive`, so
the `ympc` harness can score it and on-road logs show engagement without another replay.

### What does not exist yet

**`dyPath` is not computed anywhere online.** It exists only in the host-Python analysis scripts in
the `oprad-routes` volume at `/routes/an2/`; every number in items 35–37 is an offline quantity read
out of `ycen_*.csv`. Before any tune is written:

- compute `dyPath` per slot in the planner from `sm['modelV2'].position` interpolated at the lead's
  own `dRel`, and `dyPath_ml` from the matching `leadsV3` entry;
- define the degenerate cases — `dRel` past the model horizon, short or invalid `position` — as
  returning **`nan`, where `nan` means no attenuation**, so every failure falls toward braking;
- **prove the online value reproduces the offline `ycen` value on stored frames.** Without this the
  entire census is measuring a different quantity than the one that would ship.

### Acceptance gates — do not merge before all of these

Scored as variant `D` in the existing `$T/an2/ympc.py` matrix (`A` baseline, `B`/`C` the rejected
gate on one/both slots).

| Window | Required |
|---|---|
| 23e 1783–1792 s | **0 differing cycles.** Hard gate — anything else means the clause 3 clamp is wrong. |
| 241, all 8 hard-brake episodes | 0 differing cycles |
| `000001f9` 29:52 — D-041's own regression, two stopped cars, 88/88 frames railed | untouched; proves the bound cannot engage on a railed on-path stopped car |
| 245 234–243 s | time below −2.5 m/s² at or below variant C's 1.00 s |
| Fleet, all 113 hard-brake episodes | no episode whose baseline min `aTarget` < −2.5 with an on-path lead finishes softer than −1.5 |

Plus a unit test asserting clause 3 directly against synthetic obstacle columns, so the
non-escalation property belongs to the code and not to the routes that happen to be on hand.

### Honest cost

Three interacting scalar clauses, a new online geometric quantity, and a sign-sensitive edit to the
MPC's obstacle columns, on the longitudinal path of a car that gets driven. That is materially more
machinery than the gate it replaces. The reason to accept it is that the simpler thing was measured
and it was worse.

**Replay and static evidence only. Nothing in this decision has been driven, and clause 3's
structural claim is an argument until a test asserts it.** Until then the repo carries this as a
design, exactly as it carries D-048.

## D-062 — IMPLEMENTED: a lasting, clean run of rate-check coasts re-roots the Bosch-A vRel rate fit
**Decided 2026-09-23 on parser replay (STATUS 70). Static and replay evidence only; not road-validated.**

### The failure

The one-sided multi-sweep rate check (D-054) fits `track.samples`, and `samples` grow only on
accepted sweeps. A `vrel_inconsistent` sweep coasts vRel without appending, even though its range has
passed the innovation gate. When a lead turns from opening to closing, the frozen fit keeps the old
opening rate and rejects every correct closing U11 that follows, so the check latches itself. Route
`00000258--626242f48b` 43:29-43:46: `tid 13` held vRel −0.45 for 12.7 s while its range fell
124 → 31 m and U11 read −3.3 → −8.7 m/s, then planner FCW (STATUS 69).

### The decision

Collect consecutive range-passed, rate-inconsistent sweeps in `track.inconsistent_run` (cleared by
any rate-consistent sweep, any range rejection and any lifecycle discontinuity). When that run passes
the D-057 `_bosch_a_lasting_clean_step` test — at least 8 sweeps over at least 1.5 s, none degraded,
ranges on a line within 1.0 m RMS, and that line's slope within 3.0 m/s of the median U11 — re-root
`samples` on the run's most recent points and publish the sweep's vRel as measured. No constants are
new; all are reused from D-054 and D-057.

### Rejected alternative: F1, append every coasted range to `samples`

It unfreezes the fit immediately, but it re-admits over-closing U11 (the D-056 failure). On
`00000231--5782493b00`, newly measured vRel over-closed the next-1 s range slope by more than
3 m/s on 17.0% of sweeps against 6.8% for the reference parser.

### Evidence and known cost

Paired replay over 24 cached rlog routes (STATUS 70): on each sweep where D-062 publishes a measured
vRel that the current parser coasts, the re-rooted value was nearer the next-1 s range slope on 235
sweeps and the coast on 79; lead 73 vs 35; summed absolute error 815 vs 1,627 m/s. No radar point
and no lead point is lost. **The lead result is not uniform:** route 258 is 71 to 0 for D-062, but
`00000241` is 0 to 16 and `0000024f` 2 to 19 against it, and both lose by over-closing (earlier or
harder braking, not missed braking). Three lead routes are too few to tune on (AGENTS.md rule on
constants); revisit with road evidence rather than by tightening the D-057 thresholds offline.

## D-063 — IMPLEMENTED behind `BoschARailInterval` (default off): a railed U11 is a bound, not a value, for in-path tracks
**Decided 2026-09-23 on parser replay (STATUS 82, 89, 90). Static and replay evidence only; not road-validated. Peter asked for it as a default-off toggle.**

### The failure

The Bosch-A direct closing-speed channel (U11) pins at -13.5 m/s. The D-054 range gate and the D-057
re-anchor predict the next range from U11, and with U11 pinned they predicted exactly 13.5 m/s of
closing. A lead closing faster contradicted that prediction on every sweep: route 25e track 59 went
dark from 100 m until 41 m while closing at 15-17 m/s (STATUS 82).

### The decision

When the toggle is on and the track is within 2.0 m of straight ahead
(`BOSCH_A_RAIL_INTERVAL_MAX_Y_M`), a railed U11 predicts the range interval for closing speeds from
13.5 up to 20 m/s (`BOSCH_A_DIRECT_VREL_RAIL_BOUND_MPS`) in both the gate and the re-anchor. A sweep
admitted only through that interval (`rail_admitted`) enters the D-059 hold, so the published vRel
stays unmeasured until a fresh fit agrees. Nothing about the published closing speed changes; only
whether the lead is kept does. Off by default because the evidence is replay only.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Variant D (interval for every track, STATUS 82):** loses 24-32 m off-axis points on 3 routes and
  admits adjacent-lane over-closers with U11 on the rail.
- **Variant D' (4 m gate, STATUS 89):** removes the lost points but keeps three adjacent-lane
  over-closers (25e track 6, 25f track 33, 262 track 9) inside 4 m of the path.
- **Reusing `RangeDerivedVrel` as the switch:** that toggle is already on in the car, so D'' would
  have gone live without a decision. A new key keeps it off until flipped.
- **Removing D-053 in favour of this:** the two act on different layers (D-053 publishes more closing
  on a live lead; D-063 keeps a lead alive), and D-053 fired usefully on the real closers in the
  stock-ACC routes (STATUS 90). Both stay.

### Addendum 2026-09-24 (coast bound, STATUS 92)

The two coast branches (`high_u10_live_vrel or vrel_inconsistent or rejoin_hold`, and
`u11_and_ratio_unavailable`) published `last_trusted_vrel` verbatim as `measured=False`. With the
interval on, that value can be the -13.5 rail on a point whose range is opening (25e 403 s, a
replayed -3.45 m/s^2 with no threat). With the toggle on, `_bosch_a_coast_vrel` now clamps the coast
to within 3 m/s of a least-squares range rate over the samples the coast itself gathered
(`rejoin_samples`, else `inconsistent_run`), with the D-043 minimum window (4 samples, 0.25 s) and
no one-sweep derivatives. The off path is untouched. Replay: the 25e -3.0 crossing is gone
(min -2.39), five other windows identical. The toggle stays off: the first 0.26 s after a re-root
still coast the rail, and the walk was admitted on a DEGRADED sweep where the interval widened a
2 m gate by 0.39 m. Next: use the exact rate, not the interval, on degraded sweeps.

## D-064 — IMPLEMENTED behind `ICBMFarLead` (default ON at the owner's request, stock off): ICBM lowers the set speed toward a stopping-distance speed for a closing lead the chill plan ignores
**Decided 2026-09-24 on 25e replay (STATUS 94). Replay and unit evidence only; not driven. Peter asked for it to ship on so he can try it on the next update.**

### The failure

ICBM (`RedneckCruise`) has one lead input: the chill MPC plan's minimum speed. On 25e a stopped-ish
lead was visible at 102 m closing 7.5 m/s, but the plan did not dip below the set speed until 83 m,
so the first decel press came 1.5 s after the lead was known, and the 2 steps/s set-speed walk then
ran out of road (STATUS 94). Peter's expectation, "if OP already detects a stopped lead from far
away, command stock ACC to slow down," is the right one for a system whose only brake is the ACC
set speed.

### The decision

`select_redneck_target_speed` takes `lead_speed_ms` (default `None`). With the toggle on, `card.py`
passes `leadOne.vLead`; when the lead is closing, the target is capped at
`sqrt(vLead^2 + 2 * FAR_LEAD_DECEL_MS2 * (d - max(FAR_LEAD_MIN_GAP_M, FAR_LEAD_HEADWAY_S * vLead)))`
with 1.5 m/s^2, 6 m and 1.5 s: the speed from which a comfortable decel reaches the lead's speed at
the desired gap. The cap wraps every return of the plan block, so it only ever lowers the target.
`None` (toggle off) leaves the HEAD arithmetic byte-identical (replay max difference 0.0). On 25e the
first press moves from 724.07 to 723.02 s and the simulated set runs ~2 mph lower throughout; the
317 s episode is unchanged; the 310.5 s U11-rail episode gets one extra step (D-063 interaction,
mitigated by `BoschARailInterval`).

### Rejected alternatives

- **Raising `LEAD_PROACTIVE_COAST_HEADWAY_MAX_S`.** Widens the coast for every closing lead, not just
  the far ones the plan ignores, and the coast is a fixed buffer, not a distance-aware target.
- **Lowering the hold band (`LEAD_RECOVERY_HOLD_BUFFER_MS`, 1.5 mph).** Behaviour change on every
  ICBM drive for ~0.5 s of gain; Peter said change nothing else before the bench test.
- **Changing the planner (chill MPC) floor.** Brake-affecting on alpha long too, retained for Claude
  and needs Peter's OK; the far-lead rule keeps the change inside ICBM.
- **Changing the 662 send pattern (counter sync on by default, press-release taps).** The press/step
  dump says the step rate is locked to the counter beat, so `ICBMCounterSync` is the likely fix, but
  it is measured by the STATUS 94 bench test, not assumed.

### Limits

The walk is still limited to ~2 steps/s and the 25 mph floor; a far target cannot make stock ACC
brake harder than the set-speed walk allows. The 726-728 s stall (presses out, no steps) is not
explained. If the set speed comes down too early on the road, the toggle is in Galaxy Developer
Mode as "ICBM Far-Lead Slowdown".

## D-065 — IMPLEMENTED: `ICBMCounterSync` defaults on, and ICBM yields to a held physical cruise button for the whole hold plus 0.5 s
**Decided 2026-09-24 on the bench routes 264/265 (STATUS 95) at the owner's request (STATUS 96). Sync: limited road evidence. Yield: unit evidence only; not driven.**

### The failure

Two things from the bench drives. (1) With the free-running 662 counter the set-speed walk is
~2 steps/s; with the counter synced to the car's own SCM_BUTTONS frames it is ~6-7 steps/s, and
every lead approach on ICBM depends on that rate. (2) `RedneckCruise` blocked its own presses for
only 0.5 s from a physical button's press edge and unblocked on release in the same frame. The Honda
ECU auto-repeats 5 mph per ~0.5 s under a hold, so any hold longer than 0.5 s had ICBM pressing
decel against the driver's held RES+ (264 at 101.5 s, 265 at 156.5 s); with sync on, ICBM won.

### The decision

- `ICBMCounterSync` ships on (`params_keys.h` default "1").
- ICBM yields while any cruise button is physically held (`cruise_button_held`, capped at
  `MANUAL_BUTTON_HELD_MAX_S` = 10 s so a missed release edge cannot silence ICBM for the drive) and
  for `MANUAL_BUTTON_INACTIVE_TIMER` = 0.5 s after the release edge. The driver's finger always
  wins; ICBM resumes half a second after it lifts.

### Rejected alternatives

- **Folding the ECU's 5 mph hold steps into openpilot's cruise target.** The target side
  (`selfdrive/car/cruise.py` long-press logic) already diverges from the ECU under a hold (265 at
  1:38.8: ECU at the 25 mph floor, `vCruise` at 8 km/h). Reconciling them is a target-side change on
  every car, not an ICBM change, and needs its own evidence. Left as the open residual in STATUS 96.
- **Keeping the 0.5 s window but restarting it on each ECU step.** The ECU's steps are visible only
  through the cluster speed, which lags; the press edge and release edge are the direct signal.
- **No cap on the hold.** A missed release edge (CAN drop, state reset) would then disable ICBM
  until the next press; 10 s is longer than any deliberate hold to the floor (2.5 s) or ceiling.

### Limits

The yield is measured by unit tests only. Whether a held button on the road produces a clean press
and release edge pair in `buttonEvents` on every hold is the bench question in STATUS 96.

## D-066 — `eps_tools/rwd_format/` is canonical; `eps_tools/rwd_xray/format/` is reference only
`eps_tools/rwd_xray/` is cfranyota/rwd-xray at 8d8e1ff3 (MIT), folded in on the owner's request for EPS firmware analysis. Content-hash compare against the tracked tree: `header.py` and `header_value.py` are identical to `rwd_format/`; `base.py`, `x31.py` and `x5a.py` differ only by the Python-3 port (relative imports, bytes indexing instead of `ord`). Run `rwd_format/`; keep `rwd_xray/` unedited as the source of the per-EPS patch offsets and stock/modified table values in `tools/eps_tool.py`.

## D-067 — IMPLEMENTED: no lane-change side filter in `match_vision_to_track`
StarPilot's `HumanLaneChanges` dropped every radar track on the far side of 0 m (left change: yRel <= 0,
right change: yRel >= 0) during `laneChangeStarting`. The function only pairs a radar track with the
vision lead, which must already agree in distance, speed and lateral position, so the filter never
changed which car was followed. It could only take radar away from it (D-041/D-042: a gate that can only
delete radar points is removed rather than tuned).

Evidence (replay/closed-loop sim, `--bearings 0.075`, filter re-applied vs removed, route 00000293):
- 10:49 left change: the new lane's car (track 61) crossed to y -0.2..-0.4 as we arrived. With the filter
  it went vision-only for ~2.5 s and the sim brake came late, -1.7 then -3.3; without it radar stays on,
  the brake starts earlier and plateaus at -2.6..-2.9, min gap 11.9 -> 13.1 m.
- 29:13-29:16 right change on a curve: track 12 at y +0.2..+1.2. With the filter vision put the car at
  64-79 m (radar 53-67) and the merge push held +0.5 until radar returned at 52.6 m; without it the push
  releases ~1 s earlier, the later brake is -1.79 vs -1.92, min gap 41.8 -> 43.6 m.
- 294 13:10: no difference (the lead was lost for another reason).
- Route 00000296 (device without this change): radar was on the lead for 0-53% of each of 5 lane changes.

Limits: replay only; no road drive with this change yet. `test_leads.py`
`test_match_vision_to_track_keeps_new_lane_car_during_human_lane_change` pins both 293 geometries.

## D-068 — REJECTED: publishing a high-U10 birth as a bound
Route 00000296 5:16 (route 322.05-322.38 s): track 17, the real in-lane lead slowing to a stop at
66 -> 63 m, had U10 above `BOSCH_A_DIRECT_VREL_MAX_UNCERTAINTY_RAW` on all six sweeps. With no accepted
sample and no trusted vRel, the coast path had nothing to coast, so the object was never published.

Tried (not committed): publish such a birth, in lane (|y| <= 2 m) and from 25 m out, once its own ranges fit
(4 samples over 0.25 s, rms <= 1 m), with vRel = max(live U11, fit - 3 m/s), measured=False. It did not stay
in the tree. Open-loop A/B replay, `--bearings 0.075`:
- 00000296: no gain. Track 17 was published for its last two sweeps only and never became the lead. The
  5:16 command was unchanged; 0 harder and 0 softer frames on the route.
- 00000294 7:06 (route 426.4 s): track 16, a new in-lane car at 69 m. Its birth U11 was railed at -13.5
  and its settling birth ranges fit about -13.6, so the bound was -13.5. The radar then read -5.6 a few
  sweeps later. Vision also said -13 then, so the bound was not a new wrong distance or speed on its own.
  But radard's lead filter, seeded at -13.5 and then corrected to -5.6, reported the lead ACCELERATING at
  +3..+5.7 m/s^2 for ~1.1 s (426.9-428.0). Without the change it reported -0.2 falling to -3; the lead was
  starting to brake. The command was softer by up to 0.5 m/s^2 in that window (peak -2.39 vs -2.76) and
  crossed -1.5 slightly harder at 428.0 (-1.63 vs -1.47).

Reason: a birth's own ranges are still settling (00000239), and a railed birth U11 is only a bound (D-063).
Neither gives a vRel good enough to seed radard's filter. A wrong-direction lead acceleration can make a
real brake late, which is worse than 296's extra 2 s of vision-only lead. Any retry needs a birth vRel
that does not seed the lead filter's acceleration, and a replay showing a gain. The patch is not kept;
this entry is the record. Replay evidence only.

## D-069 — REJECTED: NC-at-rail (NORMALIZED_CLOSING past the U11 low rail)
Recorded 2026-09-30 on `stopshadow-radar` only. Replay evidence only; nothing driven.

The idea: U11 rails at −13.5 m/s, and F2 NORMALIZED_CLOSING (23|10, 1/64, centre raw 512) times dRel is an
unrailed closing channel (stopshadow corpus: 0.91–0.95 of the long-window range rate past the rail, sigma
F2 46|7 < 32 on 99.7 % of stopped railed rows < 50 m). The parser change (c40fe684f, `BOSCH_A_NC_RAIL_VREL`)
replaced a low-rail U11 with −NC·dRel for |yRel| ≤ 2 m, 0 < dRel < 50 m, sigma < 32, and only when it agreed
within 3 m/s with the trailing range fit; clamped to [−20, rail], 0.3 s hold.

Replay (tools/longitudinal/stopshadow/ncrail.txt, 8f3b15028; 22 routes, open-loop planner), ON vs OFF:
- No gain. 148 point-sweeps changed on 14 routes; 38 of 44 episodes were never a lead and 31 tracks were
  oncoming. Zero leadOne/leadTwo/leadOnpath selection changes, identical planner minimum and FCW counts,
  identical time to correct closing on all 6 railed leadOne episodes. radard's D-053 rail-fast assist
  (radard.py:793-819) already covers those leads at publish time; under NC it shrinks and never doubles.
- Added roughness on the KF input. Sweep |dvRel| p95 5.6 vs 0.4 m/s, 76 steps > 3 m/s vs 0, mostly the full
  −13.5 ↔ −20 step on |y| or rate-check release. Over-close > 3 m/s vs the next-1 s range slope on 19.6 % of
  changed sweeps vs 7.1 % for the rail (mean error +2.4 vs +6.3).
- D-068 check clean: no fake lead acceleration (aLeadK > +1 only in ON) anywhere; protected brakes unchanged.

Reason: a change with no measured benefit that makes the native vRel flicker is not worth carrying. The
switch is False and the code and TestNcAtRail stay for the record. A retry needs a case D-053 rail-fast
misses (a railed in-lane car that is not leadOne/leadTwo but matters to the planner), and must publish NC as
a bound at radard publish time, not as the native vRel, so the lead KF never sees the step.

Addendum (3bac76a7b, replay): 000001f9 29:52, the D-041 origin case (segments 28-30; 288 not scored, its full
name is unrecorded). Rail-fast already published correct closing for the stopped car (tid 61, U11 railed on every
sweep) at 1801.94, identical ON and OFF. NC engaged only for 4 sweeps at 42-39 m, 1.1 s later, over-reading closing by
3.2 m/s vs 2.3 for the rail. Planner min −5.85 vs −5.86. At NC engage, leadOne aLeadK stepped −3.41 → −5.3 for ~0.4 s
(OFF −3.4), and on tid 7 at 1731.49 ON added a real FCW frame (aLeadK −4.95 vs −3.54). That is the harder-braking sign,
not D-068's softening, but the same mechanism: an NC step fed into the lead KF. D-069 stands.

## D-070 — PROPOSED (switch OFF): cap RAIL_FAST with NORMALIZED_CLOSING (`RANGE_VREL_RAIL_NC_CAP`)
**Superseded by D-071 (2026-09-30): the cap code and `RANGE_VREL_RAIL_NC_CAP` are removed** (inert on all six
episodes). RadarPoint ncVRel/ncValid now carry NC with no range or sigma limit, plus ncSigma; consumers apply their
own limits. `tools/longitudinal/stopshadow/nccap_ab.py` is kept as the historical replay and no longer runs against HEAD.
Recorded 2026-09-30 on `stopshadow-radar`. Plan: docs/PLAN_NC_CAP_RAIL_FAST.md (approved by Peter). Code f6cb7630e.
Static unit tests + open-loop replay only; nothing driven. Enabling the switch is Peter's call.

Implemented: the parser publishes RadarPoint.ncVRel/ncValid (from `_bosch_a_nc_vrel`, independent of D-069's switch;
ncValid False on coasts). With the switch on, a RAIL_FAST correction on a railed point with valid NC is shrunk so
published vRel >= ncVRel - 3.0; floored at zero, so it never publishes less closing than the U11 rail (D-041) and never
drops or coasts a point. Static: switch off is byte-identical; honda 345 passed, radard/lead/range-assist 290 passed.
Note: the plan's test "NC -10, RAIL_FAST -16.2 -> published >= -13.0" is unreachable without going above the rail;
the cap zeroes the correction there (published -13.5), which is what the test asserts.

Replay (tools/longitudinal/stopshadow/nccap_ab.py, nccap_ab.txt). NOT Bob's setup: code f6cb7630e (stopshadow), not

Result (replay): the cap is INERT. Pass conditions: no lost gain on 271/236/237 (met, trivially); 298 unchanged (met);
297 -16.2 excursion gone (NOT met: -16.54/-16.24/-15.85 at 48:12.47-12.60, identical OFF and ON). Reason: NC is valid
only under 50 m (`BOSCH_A_NC_RAIL_MAX_D_REL_M`) and at sigma < 32; 297 track 4 was at 55.9-72.9 m with sigma 20-42, and
298's railed leads at 60-92 m. Diagnostic only (limit ignored): 297 -NC*dRel read -8.0..-11.4, so a valid NC would have
removed the correction; 298 read -18.4..-23.3, agreeing with the rail. Positive control (harness margin 0, 271): 22
frames change lead vRel, 0 change the planner. The -4.4 at 297 was logged aEgo (-4.50 @ 48:13.17), not the planner.

Status: kept OFF. Not recommended to enable as is: it changes nothing on the six episodes. Making it act at 297 needs
NC trusted past 50 m and above sigma 32, a constant change that needs its own evidence (D-042's lesson) and Peter's call.

## D-071 — PROPOSED (switch OFF): veto RAIL_FAST when NORMALIZED_CLOSING says clearly less closing than the rail (`RANGE_VREL_RAIL_NC_VETO`)
Recorded 2026-09-30 on nc-cap-v2 (PR #11, base d9ca5b342). Static unit tests + log analysis + open-loop replay only; nothing
driven. Enabling the switch is Peter's call. Evidence and harness: tools/longitudinal/stopshadow/ncveto.txt, ncveto_*.py.

Problem: D-070's cap is inert at 297 48:12 (00000297--f971b5896f, tid 4), where RAIL_FAST published -16.54/-16.24/-15.85
at 61.8-64 m while the truth was about -8.5, because NC there is outside ncValid (> 50 m, sigma 20-42).

Rule: on a railed lead with a RAIL_FAST correction, if the median of the track's last <= 5 NC vRels within 0.5 s (>= 3,
each limited in radard by `RANGE_VREL_RAIL_NC_VETO_MAX_D_REL_M` 80 m and `RANGE_VREL_RAIL_NC_VETO_MAX_SIGMA_RAW` 64, read
from RadarPoint.ncVRel/ncValid/ncSigma, which the parser publishes with no range or sigma limit) is >= rail + 3.5 m/s, the correction is zeroed and the rail itself is published. One-sided:
it only ever removes a RAIL_FAST correction, never publishes less closing than the U11 rail (D-041), never drops or coasts a
point (D-041/D-042). No existing constant or gate is changed (ncValid keeps 50 m / sigma 32). Off: byte-identical (static).

Evidence (log; truth = future ground-frame range fit t+0.2..t+1.2 s, which uses no NC, no U11 and no past range):
- NC 5-sweep median minus truth on 1248 non-oncoming railed rows, 8 routes: median -0.3 / +0.1 m/s at 50-75 / 75-100 m
  (p10/p90 -4.9/+3.4 and -6.2/+5.1), +3.1 past 100 m. NC under-reads closing far out (271 9:27 at 104 m: -16.2 vs
  -19.5..-22.5), so the veto stops at 80 m and uses NC only one-sidedly, against the rail.
- On every RAIL_FAST firing row of the six episodes: 297 median -8.4..-8.7 (rail +4.8..+5.1); nearest gain case 236
  12:52.60-12:53.35 median -10.9..-11.5 (rail +2.0..+2.6, truth -15..-21); 271 -13.0..-17.3; 237 -13.3..-14.5; 298 -20.3.
- Over all railed rows < 80 m (not only RAIL_FAST rows), the rule would fire on 26 non-oncoming rows, 3 with truth past
  rail - 1 (26b 24:11 tid 30, truth -14.8..-15.3, never a RAIL_FAST row).

Open-loop A/B replay (ncveto_ab.py; OFF / OFF2 A/A / ON; each route's own initData params; A/A 0 diffs everywhere):

| episode | min lead1 vRel OFF → ON | max rail corr OFF/ON | planner min OFF/ON | changed frames (vRel / accel) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 271 9:26 | -20.00 → -20.00 | 6.50 / 6.50 | -6.29 / -6.29 | 0 / 0 |
| 236 12:51, 12:54 | -18.43 → -18.43 | 4.93 / 4.93 | -3.29 / -3.29 | 0 / 0 |
| 237 10:00 | -17.39 → -17.39 | 3.89 / 3.89 | -2.60 / -2.60 | 0 / 0 |
| 298 4:10 | -14.58 → -14.58 | 1.08 / 1.08 | -3.61 / -3.61 | 0 / 0 |
| 297 48:12 | -16.54 → -13.50 | 3.04 / 0.00 | -3.65 / -3.66 | 5 / 84 (max 0.46 softer) |
| negatives: 245 3:59, 245 11:30, 26b 24:11, 26b 25:55.7, 289 15:11.9, 297 46:59.2 | unchanged | 0 / 0 | unchanged | 0 / 0 |

Result: the 297 excursion is gone; the RAIL_FAST gain on 271/236/237/298 is untouched. The planner minimum at 297 is NOT
improved (-3.66 vs -3.65, ON softer by up to 0.46 for 0.6 s first): the rail itself (-13.5 vs truth ~-8.5) still drives
that brake, and the rail is the D-041 floor this rule may not cross. The negatives are weak (RAIL_FAST never corrected in
them). The threshold window is narrow and set by one case per side: Y 2.0 loses 236's gain for 16 frames, Y 5.0 misses one
297 sweep; 3.5 sits ~1 m/s from each.

Rejected: (a) D-070's cap with NC trusted to 80-100 m — per sweep it also cuts real gain on 236 (20-25 sweeps, up to
4.3 m/s), 237 (8-10) and 271 (4-12), because NC past 50 m is noisy and the cap compares NC to RAIL_FAST's output, not to
the rail; (b) short/long range-fit agreement on young tracks — at 297 the fits agree (|diff| 0.1-0.8, both on the newborn
convergence tail) while 271 disagrees (3.3-4.4): it would cut 271 and keep 297. Min-age / rsig gates stay rejected.

Car-matched A/B (Bob, 2026-09-30; code 5d7be6e730, params 2026-09-30T17:50:49Z, OFF and ON in separate processes,
OFF-vs-OFF 0 diffs on 6 windows; replay and static only). Does not include ns-bosch-radar-testing's later radard changes
(e.g. 3fc070837 FAR_RAIL_VISION_BOUND).
- Named episodes: 271 9:26, 236 12:51/12:54, 237 10:00 and 298 4:10 never fire, and 0 frames change (closest 236, 0.90
  below the threshold). 294 7:06 has no RAIL_FAST correction. 297 48:12 fires on 3/3 calls (NC median -8.41..-8.74,
  sigma 25-26, 61.8-63.0 m): lead vRel -16.24 → -13.50, planner min -3.63 → -3.61.
- 109 rail windows on 40 routes, RAIL_FAST armed in 20: the veto fires only at 297 48:12 and at a NEW case, 278 4:37
  (00000278--8f101d683e, tid 61, 62.6-65.7 m). It fires on 4/12 calls there, with NC median 3.72-3.97 above the rail
  (sigma 14-17). Lead min -15.29 → -14.96 (ON publishes the rail, -13.50), planner min -2.42 → -2.41. Largest planner-min
  change anywhere: 0.01.
- **278 is a WRONG fire (log; Bob, ground-frame truth by ncveto_extract/ncveto_truth, same method as 297).** The fires are
  at 4:38.48-4:38.68 (tid 61, 62.6-65.7 m). Truth is -14.88/-14.77/-14.70/-14.57, i.e. 0.07-0.38 PAST rail - 1, so the
  veto removed a real correction. OFF (RAIL_FAST -15.29..-15.09) was 0.41-0.52 more closing than truth; ON (-13.50) is
  1.07-1.38 less closing. On this track NC read about 5 m/s less closing than truth from 62 to 86 m (median -9.7 vs
  -14.9; 50-75 m NC minus truth +4.82, n 54, 80% > +3.5). The rough lead-distance fit used first had called it correct.
  Near misses 4:38.78-4:39.23 (NC 3.23-3.38 above the rail) did not fire; truth there is -14.50..-14.21.
  Before Bob's truth run, ncveto_extract.py spied `_bosch_a_nc_vrel`, which runs only with D-069 on, so it produced
  empty NC; it now spies `_bosch_a_nc_published`.
- **Threshold: no evidence-backed window.** 236 needs Y > 2.60 to keep its gain, 278 needs Y > 3.97 to avoid this wrong fire,
  and 297 needs Y <= ~4.8 to fire on every sweep. That leaves (3.97, 4.8), set by one case at each edge. NC past 50 m
  can be off by about 5 m/s in EITHER direction: right at 297 (range tail wrong), wrong at 278 (range right). Moving
  the constant to fit these three cases is the offline re-tune the repo warns against. The constant stays 3.5 and
  the switch stays OFF. The 278 cost is small (0.07-0.38 past rail - 1 for 0.2 s, planner -0.01), but this rule
  can only be justified by a gain, and at 297 its planner gain is also ~0.
- Tests on a built aarch64 tree: test_range_vrel_assist 147 passed, test_bosch_a_radar 157 passed, honda tests 346
  passed. The 2 Mac TestBuiltIn failures were the params fallback.

Synced 2026-09-30 from `stopshadow-radar` 7aaf780be2 to `ns-bosch-radar-testing` and `ns-bosch-radar-testing-pr10-smooth` at
Peter's request, with `RANGE_VREL_RAIL_NC_VETO`, `BOSCH_A_NC_RAIL_VREL` (D-069) both OFF. Code only; no behaviour change
until the switch is turned on. FAR_RAIL_VISION_BOUND (3fc070837) applies at >= 80 m and the veto below 80 m; both only
raise vRel, so they compose as floors (static). Bob's A/B above did not include FAR_RAIL_VISION_BOUND.

## D-072 — PROPOSED (switch OFF): planner-local MPC action time 0.30 s (`PLANNER_ACTION_T_OVERRIDE`)
The longitudinal planner reads its output off the MPC trajectory at action_t = actuator delay + DT_MDL,
0.55 s on the Civic (CP delay 0.50). mvl-boston/openpilot sp-honda-dev-202608 (5372439bf) reads at
0.30 s. `PLANNER_ACTION_T_OVERRIDE = True` in `selfdrive/controls/lib/longitudinal_planner.py` makes the
planner read at `PLANNER_ACTION_T_S` = 0.30 s instead, in all three read-off paths (tinygrad, plain,
classic). Nothing else moves: `CP.longitudinalActuatorDelay` (the Honda carcontroller learner's lag is
aligned to it), the live `LongitudinalActuatorDelay` toggle, `self.longitudinal_actuator_delay` and every
`reaction_t` gate built on it, the model-launch read, and the cruise and lane-change caps all keep the
actuator delay. Default OFF: with it off the read-off time is exactly delay + DT_MDL, as before
(unit tests; replay of the 4 older routes is frame-for-frame identical to the 44918d843 base).

Replay, open loop (logged inputs, planner at 44918d843 + this change; no plant, so the car's response
to the new command is not modelled). A = off (0.55 s), B = on (0.30 s). The 4 older routes are the
episode windows used in the MVL comparison; the 6 routes from 2026-09-30 are replayed over all segments
(engaged frames only). Taps = a dip below -0.5 that returns within 1 s on the same lead.

Episodes: 237 10:00 crosses -0.5 and -1.0 0.05 s later, min -2.67 → -2.63; 297 48:12 crosses -0.5
0.30 s later (2888.57 → 2888.87), -1.0 unchanged (2891.97), min -3.62 → -3.54; 236 12:51 and 298 4:10
unchanged in timing, min softer by 0.01 and 0.06. The two new taps (0000029c 387.9, 000002a2 438.0) are
dips A also made (A -0.63 / -0.56, B -0.61 / -0.52); B's is shorter, so it counts. Bookmarks (±10 s):
0000029c 4:49 no timing change, max |B−A| 0.06; 0000029e 5:17 crosses -1.0 0.10 s later, min -1.12 →
-1.07; 000002a2 7:39.2 (the -3.55 brake at 453.8, 5 s before it; 2 m/s behind a lead at 17 m at the bookmark) crosses -0.5 and -1.0 at
the same time, min -3.55 → -3.51, frames >2 m/s³ 30 → 23.

A/A (A run twice): identical on 8 routes; 0000029c differs on 1 engaged frame by 0.008, 0000029f on
262 disengaged frames (the planner's wall-clock timers); every metric above is unchanged by it.

The first MVL study moved the whole delay (0.25 s, so every `reaction_t` gate too), not only the
read-off: on the 4 older routes that gave RMS ×0.94, >2 m/s³ 129 → 108, taps 7 → 3. The read-off alone
gives ×0.97, 129 → 116, taps 7 → 4, with the same 297 onset cost. The rest came from the gates, which
also size brake caps for closing leads and are not changed here.

Rejected alternative: changing `CP.longitudinalActuatorDelay` or the live delay toggle. It would also
move the Honda carcontroller's learner alignment and every lead-brake `reaction_t` gate.

Cost to weigh: later and slightly softer braking onsets (up to 0.3 s, up to 0.09 m/s² at the peak) on
real brakes. Open-loop replay cannot show how the car responds to the smoother command. Replay and
unit-test evidence only; not road-validated. To try it: set `PLANNER_ACTION_T_OVERRIDE = True`.

**Update 2026-09-30 — closed-loop replay and a driver trial toggle.** Closed loop on the fitted plant,
car-matched to pr10-smooth 07b66420 (17 episodes): the command is smoother (RMS jerk ×0.64-0.93, light
taps 19 → 14) but the simulated car's own accel changes only ~3 %. Brakes that build slowly start
0.10-0.30 s later; on 0000029d's hardest brake the closest gap goes 6.0 → 5.6 m, and steady following
sits 0.4-2.2 m closer. Six episodes trip the flag rule. The replay recommendation was not to turn it on;
Peter asked to try it on the road, so it ships behind the `PlannerShortActionTime` param (Advanced
Longitudinal Tuning), default ON at his request, still switchable (re-read about once a second; a params
error reads as off).
`PLANNER_ACTION_T_OVERRIDE` stays False and still forces it on for replays. With the toggle off, a
closed-loop replay of 7 car-matched jobs is frame-for-frame identical to the 44918d843 base. Replay
evidence only; not road-validated. Status stays PROPOSED until drives with it on are reviewed.

Shadow marker added 2026-10-01 (Peter's request, STATUS 197): radarState leadOne/leadTwo `ncVetoShadow` is True on each update
where this rule would zero a RAIL_FAST correction, with the switch on or off. With the switch off, control is unchanged (static). New
drives are screened from it, and each marked moment is judged with ncveto_truth.py before it counts as evidence either way.

## D-073 — ACCEPTED (default ON): Experimental Mode close-lead cap goes deeper than chill's floor at 1.5 m/s³, closing-speed demand at once
Recorded 2026-10-01, owner-approved ("Yeah let's tune this limit … ideally I want it to work as well as chill"; "Yeah go
ahead" on the rate-limited version). Replay (open loop + closed loop with the fitted plant, car planner 87505f426,
params_car) and static unit tests only; not driven.

Problem: all 14 brake jabs Steve passed on (000002a6, 000002a4; Experimental Mode on in every window) were set by
`get_close_lead_brake_cap`. The MPC/e2e blend asked for -0.04..-0.97 while the cap applied -1.35..-3.07 in one frame. The
cap is built against `output_accel_min`, which in Experimental Mode is the vehicle minimum (-3.5) and in chill is
`accel_limits_turns[0]` (about -1.0, deepening only as a_desired follows). One aLeadK step therefore became a one-frame brake
step of up to 3 m/s² in Experimental Mode and a step to -1.0 in chill.

Rejected: building the Experimental Mode cap against chill's floor outright (V1). Closed loop it removed the jabs but cut
283 27:40's closest gap 20.6 → 10.3 m (TTC 7.8 → 3.6 s) and 2a6 15:08's 15.1 → 11.1 m; chill itself does as badly there
(9.3 m, 8.5 m). The 57-route open-loop fleet showed 48 Experimental Mode episodes where V1 sat at -1.0..-1.5 under a lead
braking at 2-5.5 m/s².

Rule (`EXP_CLOSE_LEAD_FLOOR_RATE` 1.5, `EXP_CLOSE_LEAD_FLOOR_RELAX` 2.0): in Experimental Mode, and not on the fast-closing
path, the close-lead cap is held at or above a floor that starts at chill's floor (`accel_limits_turns[0]`), goes deeper at
1.5 m/s³ while the cap asks for more, and relaxes at 2.0 m/s³ once it stops. The floor never applies below what the closing
speed alone demands (the same cap with aLeadK not counted, `count_lead_brake=False`), so a stopped car 20 m ahead at
20 m/s still gets ≤ -3.0 on the first frame. Chill and the fast-closing cap are unchanged. Nothing is deleted or coasted;
radar inputs are untouched (D-041/D-042).

Closed loop (fitted plant; min accel / biggest 0.5 s drop / closest gap m / min TTC s), today → D-073:

The other 9 jab and real-brake windows on 2a6/2a4 stay within 0.5 m of today's closest gap.

Limits: the plant misses the real brakes' ~0.8 m/s² overshoot (STATUS 195), so replay under-reads jab harshness, and the
2a6 2:42 jab only softens -2.51 → -2.31 here. The STATUS 148 stock-ACC comparison cases (25b 1338.8, 25e 318.1, 25f 483.1,

## D-074 — ACCEPTED (owner, 2026-10-02): U11 vRel is decoded at 1/72 m/s per count by default; `BoschAU11Scale72` OFF switches back to 1/64
Recorded 2026-10-01 as a test toggle (`BoschAU11Scale72`, default OFF); accepted by the owner (Peter, in chat) on
2026-10-02 as the default; after Job's range check the owner kept the toggle, now default ON, as a switch back to 1/64
(second addendum). **Static and replay evidence only; no road evidence.**

With `BoschAU11Scale72` ON (the default), U11 is `v = (raw − 864) / 72` everywhere the scale is used (`BOSCH_A_DIRECT_VREL_COUNTS_PER_MPS = 72`; the decode
divides, as the inverse of the firmware formatter). The rails are exactly ±12.0 m/s (raw 0 and 1728), down from ±13.5
at 1/64. The scale also sets the D-063 rail interval, the D-054 innovation gate, the D-057 re-anchor and the NC-at-rail
test (radar_interface.py), and in radard.py `BOSCH_A_U11_LOW_RAIL_MPS` (−12.0), the half-count on-rail tolerance
(0.5/72 m/s), the FAR_RAIL bound and the NC veto (rail + 3.5). The centre (864), the raw rails (0, 1728), the 0x7FE
sentinel, u10, range and azimuth are unchanged. No gate threshold is re-tuned. `BOSCH_A_NC_SCALE` (1/64) is the
separate NORMALIZED_CLOSING channel and is unchanged.

Evidence (firmware-analysis-kit, cited, not copied):
- static: readable Bosch-radar-partner camera firmware (36161-TLA-A070; same-family TGG-A080, TGH-A040,
  TFJ/TGG/TGL-G070) formats vRel as `round((v + 12) / 0x3c638e45)`, where `0x3c638e45` is 1/72 as an f32
  (`camera-re/bosch_a_inventory`, `radar-re/u11_encode`). Peter's camera, 36161-TBA-A130, is not available as an image,
  so this is unproven for his car.
- replay: steady-state slope is about 71 counts per m/s. Stationary objects vs GPS give 70.75 (`radar-re/u11_gps`).
  Lead-stop gives 71.55 [71.26, 72.40] and road-speed approaches give 70.90 [70.29, 71.40] (`radar-re/u11_leadstop`,
  `radar-re/u11_dynamics`). All three exclude 64.
- The one contrary result (moving leads against the range rate, k = 55–66, `radar-re/u11_moving`) is no longer
  UNRESOLVED; see the addendum.

What it does to the car: 1/72 publishes 64/72 of the old closing speed (−11.1 %), and a rail now means ≥ 12.0 rather
than ≥ 13.5 m/s. Understating closing is the D-041 danger direction; the owner accepted this on the evidence above.

`ONPATH_ADOPT_RAIL_VREL_MPS` was a fixed −12.5 ("treated as railed", 1.0 inside the −13.5 rail). It is now
`rail + 1.0` (`ONPATH_ADOPT_RAIL_VREL_MARGIN_MPS`) = −11.0. Left at −12.5, a −12.0 rail would never count as railed for
leadOnpath adoption, which would fail toward not adopting the lead. Approved by the owner 2026-10-02.
`ONPATH_ADOPT_MIN_CLOSING_MPS` 2.0 and `ONPATH_ADOPT_RATE_TOL_MPS` 2.5 were evidenced in 1/64 units and now govern 1/72
adoption, untuned (STATUS 199). In replay MIN_CLOSING decides three adoption flips, and RATE_TOL decides 284 t 2066.36
(base rejected by 0.097 m/s: slope −1.413 vs −4.010 + 2.5; 1/72 adopts: −1.255 vs −3.507 + 2.5).

Routes before 2026-10-01 published 1/64, so every m/s figure in the code comments and in this file measured on them
(13.5 rails, −16.54, −19.4, …) is in 1/64 units: multiply by 64/72 for 1/72. From 2026-10-01 the units depend on
`BoschAU11Scale72` in that route's initData (ON = 1/72), not on the date; 000002ad and 000002ae have it ON. The m/s gate thresholds whose evidence was measured in 1/64 units
were deliberately left as they are (listed in STATUS item 199).

**Addendum (2026-10-02, owner acceptance):**
- Retrace R3/R4 of the moving-lead result: binned by range, the slope estimators give OLS 53–57, inverse 67–69,
  TLS 60–62 and Deming 60–64 counts per m/s. With Job's pooled fit (STATUS 7, source 2, U10 < 64: 55.7–70.0;
  |x| ≥ 200: 58.3–70.3) the range-rate bracket is about 55–70, which contains 64 and **excludes 72**. It is not
  evidence against the 1/72 decode: the encoder is firmware-proven 1/72, and R18 (Jason, static) proved the range
  scale is raw/16 (the constant −3.0 m offset does not change a slope). It reads as a range-vs-U11 discrepancy, the range slope running 1.03–1.29× U11.
  Job's per-dRel-band range check came back mixed; see the second addendum.
- U10 v2 census (Job, replay only, 36 routes, `rs2_merged.json`, sha256
  `69ac57f8d45dd5794c3e65e551bdf92e7478fd3f7d2cce5a7bc190bc523eb868`, verified by Jason): per 7-sweep window, mean
  direct vRel minus the least-squares range slope, source 2, n = 878,077 windows. At 1/64 the bias is −0.130 m/s and
  the RMS 2.854; at 1/72 the bias is −0.077 and the RMS 2.847. 1/72 has the lower RMS in every U10 band 0–255 and every
  STATUS; the largest gap is STATUS 3, 1.776 vs 1.625. This is **consistent with, slightly favours 1/72, not
  decisive**. The census cannot fit the optimal scale (it has no raw² sums and no vRel-magnitude bins).
  Separate context, not part of this change: the residual sd rises monotonically with U10, 1.31 to 10.96 m/s, and is
  not U10/144.
- ~~The `BoschAU11Scale72` toggle, its 1/64 path and its tests are removed.~~ (superseded by the second addendum) Superseded the same day: the toggle is
  kept, default ON (second addendum).
- `tools/bosch_a_scenarios.py` now encodes at 1/72 (rail 12.0).
- `ONPATH_ADOPT_RAIL_VREL_MPS` = rail + 1.0 = −11.0 approved (not −13.0).
- Still open: a separate fit of the scale itself; no road A/B exists.

**Second addendum (2026-10-02, owner decision after Job's range check): 1/72 is the default, the toggle stays.**
- Job's per-dRel-band range check (replay only, `range2_merged.json`, sha256 fbbd08db…0e8332, verified by Jason,
  pooled by Jason from the source 2, STATUS 7 bins), copied as Jason reported it:

  A (counts per m/s by dRel band) is not flat:

  | dRel band | 1/k | n |
  |---|---|---|
  | 0–19 m | 66.8 | 145k |
  | 20–39 m | 71.2 | 108k |
  | 40–59 m | 72.4 | 26k |
  | 60–79 m | 77.0 | 9.8k |
  | 80–99 m | 67.0 | 3.6k |
  | ≥100 m | 110–230, noisy | |

  B (the set the firmware calls stationary at 1/72; through-origin y/−vEgo; 1/64 would predict 1.125):
  - 0–79 m: 0.93–1.02 (n ≈ 9.7k)
  - 80–119 m: 1.13–1.18 (n ≈ 860)

  C (all-rail windows, vEgo > 14) peaks at neither 1.00 nor 1.13. The mode is about 1.6–1.75 at 20–79 m, so it does
  not discriminate.

  **The cause of the band dependence is UNRESOLVED.**
- Owner decision (Peter, 2026-10-02): push 1/72 as the default and keep `BoschAU11Scale72` (params key default "1",
  Longitudinal row "Radar Closing Speed 1/72 Scale", Galaxy entry, feasibleparams line) as a switch back to 1/64 until
  the long-range question is settled.
- OFF is the old 1/64 path exactly: `(raw − 864) / 64`, rails ±13.5, half-count on-rail tolerance 1/128 m/s, and
  `ONPATH_ADOPT_RAIL_VREL_MPS` −12.5 (the pre-change value: `BOSCH_A_U11_LOW_RAIL_MPS + ONPATH_ADOPT_RAIL_VREL_MARGIN_MPS`
  with the −13.5 rail, radard.py line 491 at 98e6e5cc8). ON gives ±12.0, 1/144 and −11.0. The rails and half-count are
  derived from the scale, not hard-coded.
- The switch is read once at start: in the radar interface's `__init__` and once in radard `main()`. A change while
  driving does nothing until openpilot restarts. It is read with `get(return_default=True)`, so an unset key reads
  ON, and unreadable params also mean ON.
- `ONPATH_ADOPT_MIN_CLOSING_MPS` 2.0 and `ONPATH_ADOPT_RATE_TOL_MPS` 2.5 are evidenced only at 1/64 and govern 1/72
  adoption untuned (STATUS 199).
- Devices that ran this branch before 2026-10-02 had the old default ("0", OFF) written at boot. Routes 000002ad and
  000002ae show it ON on Peter's car.
- Migration: approved by the owner (Peter, 2026-10-02). It is a one-shot migration under `BoschAU11Scale72Migrated`:
  `migrate_bosch_a_u11_scale72` (starpilot_variables.py), called in manager `manager_init()` before the params-cache
  sync and before any process starts, writes the switch ON and then sets the flag. A deliberate OFF made before the
  migration, which only applied between Oct 1 and the update, is overwritten once; an OFF made after it stays.
- Galaxy server sync (`device_syncd`) skips `BoschAU11Scale72` and `BoschAU11Scale72Migrated` both ways
  (`DEVICE_SYNC_EXCLUDED_KEYS`), so a server copy taken before the migration cannot undo it. The shared `EXCLUDED_KEYS`
  is unchanged, so the switch stays editable in Galaxy and in reset, backups and profiles.
- A manual restore (device toggle backup, Galaxy restore, profile load) that brings back a stored "0" is the user's
  choice and is left as is.
- Still open: the cause of the band dependence, a separate fit of the scale itself, and the first drive at 1/72.

**Third addendum (owner, Peter, 2026-10-03): the switch back is removed.** 1/72 is built in on main and pr10-smooth.
`BoschAU11Scale72`, its Longitudinal/Galaxy row, the one-time migration (`migrate_bosch_a_u11_scale72`) and the
device_syncd exclusion are gone; radar_interface decodes at `BOSCH_A_DIRECT_VREL_COUNTS_PER_MPS` (72) and radard's
rail values are fixed at -12.0 / -11.0. `RadarInterface.u11_counts_per_mps` stays an attribute so replays of 1/64-era
logs can set it. The two param keys stay in `params_keys.h` only because the committed aarch64 `params_pyx.so` was not
rebuilt; nothing reads them. Units on routes logged 2026-10-01..10-03 still follow `BoschAU11Scale72` in that route's
initData; from this change on they are always 1/72. Static tests only; not road-validated.

## D-075 — PROPOSED (toggle OFF): `BoschANewbornLeads` publishes newborn Bosch-A points early, leads only on proven range closing
Recorded 2026-10-02, owner decision (Peter, in chat): build it as an opt-in toggle, default OFF, on main and pr10-smooth.
**Replay and static evidence only; no road evidence.** With the toggle OFF, `BOSCH_A_NEWBORN_RANGE_PUBLISH`,
`NEWBORN_RANGE_CLOSING_EXEMPT`, `NEWBORN_KF_FOLLOW_RANGE` and `NEWBORN_LEAD_NEEDS_CLOSING` are all False and the code
is the code before this work (replay-identical on 2ae, 280, 294, 284).

ON sets all four. A newborn point is published rather than held (D-041 direction: publish, do not delete), but it can
only become the lead once its own range fit is closing, so a young track's speed reading alone cannot brake the car.
No gate threshold or radar constant is changed. Both processes read the param once at startup and fail closed to OFF.

Evidence: 15-drive replay (STATUS 198). Without the closing check the early publish made phantom brakes (280 ×2, 294,
2ae seg26, 284); with it those are gone. One new early brake remains, 297 seg48 t 4572.62 (−2.00 for one frame, 0.75 s
before base, real car).

Why OFF: not driven; a newborn lead can still brake 0.75 s earlier than today (297 4572.62).

**Addendum (owner, Peter, 2026-10-03): built in on, toggle removed.** Peter drives with Radar Newborn Leads ON and
asked for the toggle to go. `BOSCH_A_NEWBORN_RANGE_PUBLISH` and radard's three NEWBORN_* switches now default True;
radard's main() calls `set_bosch_a_newborn_leads(honda_bosch_a_radar)`, so non-Bosch-A radars keep them off. The
`BoschANewbornLeads` row and reader are removed; the key stays in `params_keys.h` only to match the committed aarch64
`params_pyx.so`. The same change builds in Accel Boost (`GasOverrideBoost` removed) and, on pr10-smooth, D-072's
short read-ahead (`PlannerShortActionTime` removed). Replay and static evidence only; not road-validated.

## D-076 — ACCEPTED (owner, 2026-10-07): fixed firmware ROM-default range offset per car, no toggle
Recorded 2026-10-07, owner decision (Peter, in chat): "fix the internal code to reflect the fw default offset for my
Civic and CR-V, and remove the toggle completely." **Static evidence only; not road-measured.**

dRel = `raw/16 + bosch_a_range_offset_m(fingerprint)`:
- Civic (36802TBA A160): config word 0, so n0 = 335 (the literal fallback); offset −335/128 = −2.6171875 m.
- CR-V (36802TLA A070): config 5448, so n0 = trunc(5448/16 + 0.5) = 341; offset −341/128 = −2.6640625 m.

Against the old −3.0, Civic dRel reads 0.383 m longer and CR-V 0.336 m longer. Scale, vRel, U11, azimuth and gates
are unchanged, and range differences cancel the offset.

Removed: the `BoschARangeOffsetFallback` param, its UI rows and the CAN 0x669 runtime addend (Gemini, `04b3374034`,
`dc9d8501b4`). Reasons, from the static trace (Jason, 2026-10-06/07):
- 0x669 was a required parser message, so its absence would raise canError.
- The firmware never applies n/128 to a transmitted range. The bank range is copied unmodified (0xdb7ee → rec+0x10),
  and (range − n)/128 is used only as a lateral lever arm (0xdc004) and in the width gate (0xaa5a4).
- The object bank is camera output (bosch-a-bank-is-the-camera), so the radar's n is not the range origin.

**UNRESOLVED:**
- The true origin of the camera's range relative to openpilot's bumper-frame dRel. A laser or tape check to a parked
  car at 5/10/20/40/60 m settles it.
- NvM overrides of the config word, since Peter's radar runs A150 and no image of it is available.

Why it is still a choice and not a proof: n0 is a ROM default. A longer dRel is the less conservative direction.

Not done: the offline tools (`bosch_a_scenarios.py`, `bosch_a_dropout_census.py`, `bosch_a_sweep_trace.py`) take
`BOSCH_A_RANGE_OFFSET_M`, so they now use the Civic value. The larch64 `params_pyx.so`/`libcommon.a` still list the
removed key; that is harmless (it is never read) until the next rebuild.

## D-077 — PROPOSED (owner decision needed, no code): ramp the U11 rail bound on a track born railed, only where it cannot be a stopped object
Recorded 2026-10-04 on `ccr-3629c6b5-1hvpcd` (PR #20). **Offline statistics only; nothing implemented, nothing driven.**
This narrows D-041 (a rail is always published at full value from the first sweep), so it needs Peter's OK first.

Why: the Bosch-A bank is the camera tracker (STATUS 205), and U11 is its low-pass velocity state. The 000002d5
bookmark (t 718, −3.5 command, aEgo −4.7) was a cut-in born on the −12 rail; radard published −20 RAIL_FAST while
true closing was about 3–5 m/s. `tools/bosch_a_birth_rail_report.py` (8 routes, odometry anchors) finds born-railed
moving leads overstated in 128/130 anchored cases, decaying off the rail with excess 1/e ≈ 1.2 s, but born-railed
stopped objects (ego < 12 m/s, where they can be anchored) genuine in 61/81. A blanket ramp would delay real
stopped-object braking, which D-041 exists to prevent.

Proposal, in order of risk (owner picks; each would ship behind a default-OFF switch with replay first):
1. **+12 birth rail only** (opening; 91% spin-up). It publishes less opening than the rail, the more-closing
   direction (D-042), so it never removes braking, but it can add braking or hold back acceleration.
2. **−12 birth rail, ramp only when the track cannot be stopped:** the published bound starts at the track's own
   range-fit closing (or the rail × (1 − e^(−age/1.2 s)), whichever closes more) and reaches the full rail by
   ~2.5 s, *only* when the range fit shows the target moving (range closing clearly below vEgo) **and** ego speed
   ≥ 12 m/s. If the range fit is invalid or says closing ≈ vEgo, publish the full rail as today.
3. Do nothing; keep D-041 as is and accept rare born-railed cut-in brakes like 000002d5 (1 in 2914 born-railed
   tracks reached −20 within 3 s in this corpus).

Open before any code: the range fit is the camera's too, so (2) must first be checked against an independent
reference (STATUS 205); the settle anchor is selection-biased; about half the tracks have no anchor.

**Replay result (STATUS 206):** the range fit on a 0.25–0.5 s old track reads 20–52 m/s of closing at ego ≈ 22 m/s
(faster than a stopped object), so option 2's moving test always fails and the full rail is published. The early range
fit is as unreliable as the early U11, so it cannot be the moving test. Option 1 fired only on off-path tracks
(|y| 12–22 m). Neither option is worth enabling as written. A moving test needs a reference that exists in the first
0.5 s (candidate: an agreeing model lead at the same range with vLead ≥ 5 m/s); not built.

**2026-10-04 revision (STATUS 207).** Option 2's moving test is now an agreeing model lead (prob >= 0.5, same range within max(5 m, 15%),
lateral within 2 m, vLead >= 5 m/s, model closing >= 4 m/s short of the rail), not the range fit. Replayed on 7 routes, it fired
once (268 5:56, correct direction, 0.53 less brake); the 4 m/s margin was added after one wrong firing (2d5 9:44, the model overstated a
4 m/s lead at 100 m). Still OFF; not enough evidence to enable.

## D-078 — PROPOSED (switch `BrakeOnsetLimit`, default OFF; STATUS 209): limit the rate of brake onset only when the lead is far in time

**Decision.** The planner may rate-limit how fast its brake command grows (6 m/s^3 at TTC 3 s down to 1.5 m/s^3 at TTC >= 6 s)
only when every one of these holds: an active lead, gap >= max(10 m, 1.5 s x v), lead not braking (aLeadK >= -1.0), min TTC > 3 s,
and none of reset / standstill / stopping / vision low-speed stop / panic bypass / forced stop / red light. The ramp starts from
min(previous, 0), so throttle cuts are never slowed.

**Why these gates.** Round 1 replay (gap 1.0 s, lead-decel -1.5) softened a real closing at 236 13:15.7 (17 m, aK -1.1) and
slowed a throttle cut at 236 37:25. Round 2 removed both. Per D-041/D-042 in spirit: when it is unclear whether braking is
needed, do not hold it back — the limiter stands down rather than guess.

**Evidence.** Replay only, 7 routes: sharp onsets 217 -> 192, peak braking unchanged, largest estimated gap cost 1.27 m at a 56 m
lead. Not driven. Enabling by default needs road evidence. The Galaxy save needs the aarch64 params library rebuilt.

## D-079 — REJECTED (code reverted 2026-10-04 at owner request; STATUS 211): pull-in lead acceleration prior

For a radar lead younger than 1.5 s in its slot, slower by >= 3 m/s, TTC > 3 s, the MPC plans it speeding up (+1.5 m/s², +3 m/s cap). Replay: on the 2d5 bookmark it moves the peak from -3.65 to -3.62 (even at +5 m/s² / +10 m/s only -3.54, a shorter hold), and on 7 routes 46 of 67 firings were cars that did not speed up (worst open-loop gap cost 5.4 m). Kept off and not wired to Galaxy. Revisit only with a signal that tells a pulling-in car from a revealed slow car (e.g. lateral motion at birth); lead age alone is not that signal.

## D-080 — PROPOSED (part of switch `BrakeOnsetLimit`, default OFF; STATUS 213): bound a newborn radar lead's aLeadK

For its first 2.0 s as a lead (a gap of 0.5 s or a range step of 4 m makes it newborn again), a radar lead's aLeadK is held
at no lower than -1.0 m/s², or lower only as far as a quadratic fit of its own range history (>= 0.8 s) confirms. The lead
is never dropped and dRel/vRel are untouched (D-041/D-042: bound, do not delete). Replay: on 2df 3:09 (bookmark; track born at
85 m with aLeadK -2.39, flipping to +2.41 half a second later) the one-step -1.00 becomes an ease to about -0.3. On 2e1/2e2 it
changes 14 frames by at most 0.007. Not driven.

## D-081 — PROPOSED (part of switch `BrakeOnsetLimit`, default OFF; STATUS 213): keep the onset limit under a panic bypass when far and not yet braking

D-078 stood down entirely on a panic bypass. On 2df 24:45 (bookmark; a car turning in from the right, born at 55 m closing
12 m/s, TTC ~4.6 s, then accelerating) that let the target fall +0.57 -> -1.66 in one 50 ms step; source was the normal
lead MPC, no guard tripped, and the depth (-2.73) was what a slow lead would need. Now, under a panic bypass, the limit still
applies while the worst TTC is above 4.0 s, but only if the published target was above -0.5 m/s² when the bypass began
(latched). Round 1 without the latch softened a real stop for stopped traffic (2df 25:54, already braking -1.2, -3.5 ~0.3 s
later); the latch removes that. Peak braking is never reduced, only how fast it arrives. Replay only, not driven.

## D-082 — ADOPTED (owner, 2026-10-04; STATUS 214; amends D-053): the range-derived vRel assist arms only on the U11 rail

Owner: "If it doesn't improve brake smoothness I'd rather take it off" and "I don't mind if it starts a little later, as long
as it's smoothened out and doesn't ... look like a brake check for the car behind me." Off the rail, U11 is a reading and the
assist's disagreement there was mostly a range walk on a far lead: on 2e2 4:44 (lead at 107 m, U11 -6.6, vision -5..-7) the
range fit swung -9..-20 and the planner pulsed the brake five times (jerk -15.8 m/s³). On the rail, U11 is a bound (D-041), the
range is the only evidence of the true closing, and the assist braked 0-0.8 s earlier at the same peak. New switch
`RANGE_VREL_ASSIST_OFF_RAIL = False` in `radard.py`: the assist arms only while U11 is on the rail; a correction armed there
keeps its D-053 hysteresis and decays after U11 leaves the rail (no release step). Turning it off deletes nothing: the U11
reading is still published (D-041/D-042). The vision-assist and camera x-rate paths are off-rail refinements and go quiet with
it. `True` restores D-053 exactly. Replay only (open loop on logged ego), not driven.

## D-083 — PROPOSED (part of switch `BrakeOnsetLimit`, default OFF; STATUS 217): stock-like onset jerk cap where the onset limit stands down

When D-078/D-081 stand down on a fast-closing lead (worst TTC < 4 s), the onset jerk was unlimited, and our rail cases stepped
−36..−40 m/s³. Stock (route 299, STATUS 214) ramps the same class of onset at −1.4..−3.4 m/s³ per step. D-083 caps the onset jerk
by TTC (`BRAKE_ONSET_STOCK_JERK_V = [3.0, 1.5]`), but stands down when the braking need v_rel²/(2·gap) exceeds 3.0 m/s² or TTC is
under 2.0 s (2-frame debounce). Peak braking is never reduced, only the rise. Switch `BRAKE_ONSET_STOCK_RAMP = True` in
`longitudinal_planner.py`; `False` restores D-081 exactly. Replay result: nearly inert. One onset changes (236 9:22, jerk
−32.3 → −29.3), no peak changes, and 2d5 11:58 is unchanged because its need is 5.4. The need gate is deliberately not loosened to
catch the rail steps. Gap cost is unmeasurable in open-loop replay (doc §12.3, D-072). Replay only, not driven.

## D-084 — PROPOSED (part of switch `BrakeOnsetLimit`, default OFF; STATUS 218): a panic bypass no longer ends the D-083 ramp

Owner request after 2e5 7:58, a car merging in from a construction-blocked lane at 61 m, vRel −9.5, TTC 6.4. The panic bypass
fired with the previous target at −0.53. The D-081 latch (−0.5) therefore treated it as a hard panic and switched the stock ramp
off. With `BRAKE_ONSET_STOCK_PANIC_RAMP = True` the bypass leaves the D-083 ramp on down to the 2.0 s TTC floor. The ramp-aware need gate
(3.0 m/s², 2 frames) still ends it on urgent steps. Closed-loop sim: 2e5 worst jerk −8.2 → −2.0 m/s³, gap −0.9 m. 2df 25:54 stopped
traffic (the latch's own case) min gap 8.7 → 7.1 m near standstill. Peaks and the urgent cases are unchanged. The onset is reshaped;
depth is not. `False` restores D-081. Replay only, not driven.

## D-085 — REJECTED (STATUS 219): do not copy stock's slower far-onset ramp or its shallower depth at high need

STATUS 219 compared 12 stock routes (~132 engaged min) with ~154 min of ours using the pitch-corrected VSA accelerometer, which agrees with
GPS to about ±0.15 m/s². Two stock traits looked copyable:
- Stock commands only 0.3–0.5 × the kinematic need when the need exceeds 1 m/s². That is less braking than physics asks while
  closing, so it is rejected on safety grounds.
- Stock ramps far onsets (TTC ≥ 8 s) at a median 0.3–0.5 m/s³. In the closed-loop sim, a slower D-083 schedule
  (`[3, 1.0, 0.6]` at TTC `[3, 6, 10]`) made 2e5 7:58 worse: worst jerk −2.9 → −7.8 m/s³, deeper, and 1.2 m less gap. The deferred
  brake trips the need gate and arrives as a step. `[3, 1.5, 0.8]` was inert on every case.
D-083/D-084 stay as they are. The next stock-closeness step is road evidence from a build that runs them. Replay and offline only.

## D-086 — StockBrakeFeel: copy stock Honda ACC's brake law (depth and rate by TTC) behind one toggle; remove BrakeOnsetLimit (STATUS 220)

Owner's request; it overrides D-085's rejection, which declined to copy stock's shallower depth and slower ramp on safety grounds. The owner
accepts a closer gap ("I can always adjust the following distance myself") and asked for one toggle, not two.
- While a lead is closing and TTC > 2 s, the depth is capped at stock's p25 command for that TTC and the deepening rate at stock's (3 → 0.6 m/s³ from
  TTC 2 → 10 s). Under 2 s, or with no closing lead, the planner's depth applies but deepens at most 5 m/s³. Releases are untouched.
- Smooth Brake Onset (`BrakeOnsetLimit`) is removed from params, UI and code (D-078/D-081/D-083/D-084 superseded). The D-080 newborn-lead bound
  moves under `StockBrakeFeel`.
- Replay: smoother peaks and steps than Smooth Brake Onset on 4 of 6 cases. Simulated min gap down to 1.0 m (236 548) and 3.1 m (2df 1545). Replay
  only, not driven. Do not tighten the depth table toward stock's p50 without road evidence: it reached 0.3 m in replay.

## D-087 — ADOPTED (Gemini, 2026-10-04): Port upstream "Smooshed SLC UI" (Drawer) without losing Bosch custom toggles/features

The user explicitly requested to merge the `Dom` branch's massive Drawer UI (commits 12947fd616, cede5ddc9d) into `main` and `pr10-smooth`. Early attempts using naive `git checkout --theirs` on `starpilot_card.py` and `starpilot_vcruise.py` proved dangerous because those upstream files completely lack the custom experimental `BrakeOnsetLimit` / `StockBrakeFeel` variables, the `always_on_lateral` additions, and the specific `WHEEL_BUTTON_SOUND_PARAM` patches from earlier merges. Doing so broke the `pytest` test suite by producing `AttributeError` crashes.

As a result, the commits were properly cherry-picked. The conflicts in `starpilot_card.py` and `starpilot_vcruise.py` were resolved by meticulously grafting the upstream Speed Limit Controller (SLC) updates into the Custom Honda Bosch layout. Specifically, the SLC's `update()` logic was successfully extracted and placed ahead of the custom CSC logic in `starpilot_vcruise.py`, and the Custom `always_on_lateral` logic in `starpilot_card.py` was retained. Tests passed locally (with the exception of three pre-existing broken tests from before the cherry-pick). This preserves the hardware safety logic while satisfying the user's UI request.

## D-088: Fixed radard.py NameError and resolved test duplicates (2026-10-05)

**Context:** Running the test suite after the UI overhaul revealed three pre-existing test failures, along with a `NameError: name 'birth_vision' is not defined` crash in `radard.py`.
**Analysis:** 
1. The test failures (`test_csc_res_press_defers_to_slc_confirmation`, etc.) in `test_starpilot_vcruise.py` were caused by a bad merge artifact where the file was accidentally duplicated, causing tests missing critical setup toggles to run.
2. The `NameError` in `radard.py` was introduced in commit `1b97e72673` ("Remove the P1 range-driven lead correction (RangeLeadKF) from radard"), where `range_kf=...` was blindly replaced with `vision_lead=birth_vision`. However, `birth_vision` is not defined anywhere, and `Track.update()` does not even accept a `vision_lead` kwarg.
**Decision:** 
1. Cleaned up the duplicates in `test_starpilot_vcruise.py`. 
2. Safely removed the invalid `vision_lead=birth_vision` argument from `radard.py` to restore functionality.
**Agent:** Gemini 3.8 Flash

## D-089 — Far-range re-anchor lockout: relaxing the D-057 sigma test alone is rejected; camera-checked recovery shipped (IQ-stop-C); one-way handoff smoothing rejected as built (STATUS 225, 2026-10-08, replay only, not driven)

- **Finding.** `RANGE_SIGMA_RAW` grows with range (~0.08 x dRel), so every sweep beyond ~60 m counts as degraded and D-057 can never
  re-anchor a far lead after one range step. The lead is then camera-only until it comes close: 22 % (103 s) of camera-only lead time on 7
  routes. 59 % is the radar never reporting the car (not recoverable here), 19 % radard's lateral match.
- **Rejected: range-scaled sigma test alone** (`BOSCH_A_REANCHOR_SIGMA_FRAC` 0.15 or "ignore"). It recovers far leads on 2f5 (8.8 -> 51.9 s)
  but the recovered U11 is wrong by 7-8 m/s on 2f2/2a4/2a6, over-closing (extra brakes) and under-closing (late brakes, 2a6). Do not ship it
  without a guard. The `BOSCH_A_RANGE_SIGMA_DEGRADED_RAW` constant itself is unchanged; it still gates the rest of the interface.
- **Candidate: camera-checked recovery.** The same relaxation, but the interface flags the point `recovered` and radard uses it only after
  3 frames where a confident camera lead agrees on range, lateral and speed (dropped after 10 disagreeing frames). Closed-loop replay, 6
  routes: +34 s radar lead on 2f5, no extra brake anywhere, one shipped dip removed; one genuine slowdown (2f5 16:44.5) crosses -1.0 0.6 s
  later because it follows the radar's -3.4 m/s instead of the camera's inflated closing. **Shipped default on, IQ-stop-C only** (owner,
  2026-10-08), with a range-slope check: the point's own long-window range slope must also agree with its vRel (3 m/s, the D-043 rate
  tolerance). Replay of the shipped build: same brakes, 2f5 +31 s radar lead. Not driven. Do not loosen the camera or slope check without
  a closed-loop replay; the relaxation alone was measured to recover wrong U11.
- **Rejected: one-way handoff smoothing** (ease steps toward more braking over 0.5 s at a lead source change, bypass on TTC < 4 s or an
  agreeing range/camera speed). On 6 routes it removed no meaningful extra brake and softened one genuine episode (268 10:21.7, -1.39 ->
  -1.19) by easing a radar -> camera step. Extra brakes in these routes are not at handoffs. Do not retry it without a case where a
  handoff step is the cause; if retried, never ease toward the camera when it is the only remaining sensor (D-042).
- D-041/D-042 hold: the camera check only withholds points the shipped build never had.

## D-090 — Radar–camera pairing: a track whose U11 vRel sits on the ±12 m/s rail is judged by its own range slope when that slope is beyond the rail (STATUS 226, 2026-10-08, replay only, not driven)

- **Finding (route 000002f8--2db4adac1a, bookmark 1, ~1:30).** Radar track 52, vRel railed at -12.00 while its range slope read -19.6
  m/s (decaying to -13 as the car braked), passed the strict vision-match velocity gate by 0.14 m/s (|-12 + 13.38 - 11.24| = 9.86 < 10)
  because the rail hid the real closing. The loose preferred hold (13 m/s) then kept it. The car braked at -2.3 from 30 to 17 mph on an
  object that slid off the path; the camera's lead was a different car ~70 m ahead.
- **Shipped default on, IQ-stop-C only (owner: "Yeah let's try both"):** `RAIL_RANGE_VEL_CHECK`. For Honda Bosch A only, when vRel is
  within 0.05 of the U11 rail and the track's own range slope (long window: >= 15 samples, 0.6-1.5 s, RMS <= 1.0 m; else the young-track
  window: >= 6 samples, >= 0.35 s, RMS <= 0.6 m) has the same sign and is larger, `track_matches_vision` uses that slope instead of vRel,
  and the loose preferred hold does not apply to the track. Off the rail, or with no clean slope, nothing changes. The published vRel is
  not touched, and no point is deleted: the track just is not paired with the camera lead (D-041/D-042 hold).
- **Evidence.** Open-loop scan on 7 routes: every changed episode moves the lead toward the camera's speed (2f8 BM1 vLead 1.4 -> 11.9;
  268 702.5 s, radar 89 m vs camera 78.7 m; 26b removes vLead -9.5 and -5.0 while disengaged). No real slow lead lost. Closed-loop
  replay of 2f8 BM1: holds -1.00 over 91.0-91.5 s instead of ramping to -1.86, then brakes -2.1..-2.3 at 92.5-93.0 because the camera
  lead itself slowed (12 -> 5 m/s, likely turning off). **Partial:** fix 2 softens and delays the first second of BM1; the rest of
  that slowdown follows a real slowing car.
- Do not widen the rail band or drop the same-sign/larger test without a replay; a slope merely different from vRel is ordinary noise.

## D-091 — StockBrakeFeel's lead coast becomes a true gas-off on Honda Bosch (STATUS 226, 2026-10-08, replay only, not driven)

- **Finding (2f8, bookmark 2 and whole route).** SBF's coast caps the target near -0.33 for ~2 s when the lead closes by 0.5-1 m/s. The
  Civic Bosch carcontroller requests the brake (with brake lights) once the road-load-adjusted force drops below -0.12, so the "coast"
  went out as a brake tap. Logged car: 928 s gas, 460 s brake, 66 s true coast; replay flips 49 with SBF on vs 9 off.
- **Shipped default on, IQ-stop-C only:** `LEAD_COAST_GAS_OFF`. While the lead-coast ceiling is below zero and the planner's own
  target (before the ceiling) is at or above it (within 0.05; no emergency; published target <= 0), `longitudinalPlan.leadCoast` is
  set. This covers the coast's release too. controlsd passes it as `actuators.coast` only in
  the pid state; the Honda Bosch carcontroller then sends gas off (min gas, no BRAKE_REQUEST, no brake lights) while accel is in
  [-0.6, 0] and not stopping, and keeps the gas learner out of those frames. Any deeper planner brake clears the flag and brakes as
  before; the coast never replaces a real brake. Exit hysteresis: once on, the flag holds until the planner wants more than 0.10
  beyond the ceiling (`LEAD_COAST_GAS_OFF_EXIT_MARGIN`).
- **Tried, did not work:** tying the flag to the COAST level and the published target (each coast ended in a 0.2-0.5 s brake tap,
  55 light taps vs 31 without the fix in the 2f8 Civic-mode emulation); the planner-target rule without hysteresis (flicker, 30 taps).
  Shipped rule: 13 taps, gas<->brake flips 122 -> 43 (SBF off: 56 flips, 10 taps), braking 528 -> 364 s. Replay emulation only.
- **Caveat.** Stock's coast frames carry ACCEL_COMMAND p50 -0.39 with no brake request, so the level matches stock; but while following
  with its set speed out of the way, stock eases off with a light brake request more often than it coasts (Job/Jason, 2026-10-07).
  If the next drive shows gaps opening too fast in light closing, the margin or the -0.6 floor is the lever, not removing the coast.

## D-092 — Gentle planner easing (far lead, no lead, set speed, curve) also coasts gas-off on Honda Bosch (STATUS 227, 2026-10-08, open-loop replay only, not driven)

- **Finding (route 00000300, D-091 on).** 7 of the 12 light brake taps left were the planner itself easing at -0.17..-0.35 with
  no lead coast: no lead (6:34), a far lead at 49-104 m closing 1-2 m/s (8:30, 8:31, 11:18, 23:58), curve speed control
  (24:07, 24:13). The carcontroller sends those as a brake request once the road-load-adjusted force is under -0.12. Logged coast
  frames on the same route show the Civic coasts at -0.21..-0.29 (pitch-corrected) at 5-23 m/s, close to `get_coast_accel`.
- **Shipped default on, IQ-stop-C only, inside the StockBrakeFeel toggle:** `EASE_COAST_GAS_OFF`. `longitudinalPlan.leadCoast`
  is also set while the published target is at or below -0.10 and no deeper than the coast estimate minus 0.05 (exit: above
  -0.05 or 0.10 below the estimate). Same path to the car as D-091 (pid state only; gas off, no brake request, accel in
  [-0.6, 0]). Not while stopping, at standstill, under 5 m/s, on FCW or a stock-feel emergency, on a forced stop or a red light.
  - It may only **start from above** (target was above -0.10): never inside a brake that is already on; it re-arms once the
    target is back above -0.10.
  - It needs a coast estimate of -0.25 or deeper (flat or uphill; downhill under ~0.9 %).
- **Tried, did not work (route 300 open-loop on logged targets):**
  - The window alone: flips 43 -> 28 but light taps 12 -> 21. Brakes hovering around -0.35..-0.48 were cut into coast/brake
    pieces. The start-from-above rule fixed it: 9 taps.
  - Of those 9, all 5 new taps were on a 1.2-2.3 % downhill: the hill term already brakes there at a target near 0, so a coast
    started at -0.10 cut that brake in two. The -0.25 grade gate removed them.
- **Result (open loop, route 300):** light taps 12 -> 4, flips 43 -> 29, brake episodes 48 -> 40, coast 10.6 -> 15.0 %. The 4
  left are the same as before (two -0.45..-0.50 brakes, two at the D-091 coast exit).
  - The grade gate was chosen on the route it was scored on.
  - The flag does not feed the planner, so the car's slightly different decel while coasting is not modelled. If it
    under-delivers, the planner target deepens out of the window and the brake comes back.
- **Lever if the next drive closes on slow far leads too late or runs wide in curves:** the -0.10 upper bound and the coast
  margin, not removing the coast.

## D-093 — On Honda Bosch a positive planner target is not turned into a brake by the hill term (STATUS 229, 2026-10-09, replay only, not driven)

- **Finding (route 00000308, 6:07.5, 42 mph, no lead).** The planner asked for +0.14..+0.17 on a 3.7 % descent (logged pitch
  -0.037). The carcontroller's brake choice uses the road-load-adjusted force (target + wind + hill term), which fell to -0.12,
  so the car went into brake mode for 1.3-1.7 s with brake lights; aEgo fell from about +0.3 to about 0 against a +0.15 target.
- **Shipped default on, Honda Bosch only:** `BOSCH_HILL_BRAKE_GUARD` in `update_honda_bosch_braking`.
  - Brake mode is not entered while the target is above `BOSCH_HILL_BRAKE_MAX_ACCEL` (0.0). The frame goes out as gas off with no
    brake request, and gravity gives the car the speed the planner asked for.
  - Brake mode already on ends once the target is above `BOSCH_HILL_BRAKE_RELEASE_ACCEL` (0.20); otherwise the old force release.
  - A target at or below 0 brakes exactly as before, and stopping is untouched, so no planner brake is delayed or reduced.
- **Tried:** a 0.10 release margin let go for 0.2 s and braked again on 0000026b 12:11 (9 m/s, target swinging -0.15..+0.20).
  0.20 adds no brake episode on any replayed route.
- **Evidence (replay of the brake-mode choice on logged targets, 9 routes):** brake episodes never go up (26b 64 -> 62,
  2a4 36 -> 34, 308 29 -> 28, the rest equal); brake time at a positive target at speed 26b 10.3 -> 6.1 s, 2a4 2.2 -> 0.6 s,
  308 1.3 -> 0 s. Not modelled: the extra speed while coasting instead of braking (about +0.2 m/s^2 for 1-2 s, so under
  0.5 m/s), which the planner sees and answers with a lower target.
- **Lever if a descent runs fast:** `BOSCH_HILL_BRAKE_MAX_ACCEL` (a small positive value brakes earlier), not removing the guard.

## D-094 — The radar-only on-path brake (leadOnpath) ramps in instead of stepping to its cap (STATUS 230, 2026-10-09, replay only, not driven)

- **Finding (route 00000308, 4:09.1, 40 mph).** Track 53 sat dead centre at 24 -> 23 m, closing 6 m/s, while the camera saw a
  car at 106 m. radard published it as leadOnpath for two cycles (0.2 s) and withdrew it when its own leadOne went back to the
  radar car at 76 m. `onpath_bounded_target` stepped the target from +0.48 to -1.00 in one cycle, and the brake release slew held
  about 0.6 s of brake. Earlier, 00000297 30:18 (a stationary object on a curve edge) also drew a one-cycle step of 1.15.
- **Shipped default on (`ONPATH_LEAD_ONSET_LIMIT`, `ONPATH_LEAD_ONSET_JERK` 2.5 m/s^3, longitudinal_planner.py).** The share of
  braking that only leadOnpath asks for may pull the published target down by at most 2.5 m/s^3 from last cycle's output. This
  planner's own target, so every leadOne/leadTwo brake and anything deeper than -ONPATH_LEAD_MAX_BRAKE, passes through as before;
  the -1.0 cap and the adoption gate in radard are unchanged. 2.5 matches BRAKE_RELEASE_JERK; -0.3 -> -1.0 takes 0.28 s.
- **Rejected for this item:**
  - *Require the camera.* On 00000305 2:19.9 a real car at 61 m was leadOnpath while the camera's lead was at 83 m, and on 297
    the stopped car had camera probability 0.00-0.28. A camera gate removes real cases.
  - *Longer persistence.* It delays every real adoption: 297 31:08 had leadOnpath only 1.35 s before HEAD's radar lead.
  Both remove a published radar point's authority outright; the ramp only slows a bounded brake (D-041/D-042/D-048).
- **Evidence (closed-loop replay, current radard re-run from CAN, each variant drives its own simulated car, 13 windows):**
  308 4:09 min target -1.00 -> +0.04, biggest 0.5 s drop 1.69 -> 0.42, 0.3 s of brake -> none; 297 30:18 biggest 0.5 s drop
  1.24 -> 0.91. Identical in the other 11 windows, including the real stopped cars 297 31:08 and 46:56 (their on-path demand
  already builds gradually), 2f2 13:16/15:10 (real leads leaving the lane) and 305 2:19.9.
- **Lever if a real radar-only brake comes late:** `ONPATH_LEAD_ONSET_JERK` (larger is closer to the old step), not removing it.


## D-095 — After a gas press above the set speed, openpilot coasts back down instead of braking (STATUS 231, 2026-10-09, replay only, not driven)

- **Finding (Discord report 2026-10-09).** A driver presses the gas past the set speed and lets go. The gas press resets the
  planner to v_ego, and it then plans back to the set speed at the full profile floor (-1.0 Standard, -2.0 Sport), which reads as
  openpilot braking right after the driver lets off. Job's logged lift-offs on 27 routes: 0.5-3 m/s overshoots already ran near
  coast (command median -0.28..-0.30); the one > 3 m/s lift-off (2cc @297.4, pre D-092 build) commanded -0.56 with 63% brake.
- **Shipped default on (`GAS_OVERRIDE_COAST`, starpilot_acceleration.py).** A latch set by gasPressed above the set speed reuses
  the SLC coast-first shape (`get_slc_shaped_min_accel`) against the driver's set speed until the car is back at it. The in-window
  floor is the gas-off coast estimate (`get_coast_accel`, clipped to LEAD_COAST_MIN; downhill keeps the SLC floor), which D-092
  sends gas-off on Honda Bosch; beyond the window it builds to the profile floor as in SLC. The latch clears at the set speed, on a
  set-speed change, at standstill and when controls are off.
- **Never applies** with a braking-relevant lead, a red light / forced stop / disable-throttle, forced decel, or when CSC, SLC or
  anything else holds the planner target below the set speed. MPC lead braking keeps its full authority in every case.
- **Rejected: upstream PR 39060 (A_CRUISE_MIN -1.0 -> -0.5 everywhere).** Our A_CRUISE_MIN also sets the Eco/Sport/Traffic floors,
  the closing-lead floor (STATUS 42/61) and the close-lead brake cap; halving it weakens those.
- **First version rejected:** SLC's -0.03 in-window floor held about 1 m/s over the set speed for the whole 12 s window (light gas).
- **Evidence (replay, 11 routes):** open loop, frames with a relevant lead, stop or red light never differ (0 of ~116k). Synthetic
  overshoots at logged cruise moments, closed loop: no lead, 2 m/s over: brake below -0.3 3.1 s -> 0 s, the car ends 0.12 m/s
  faster after 12 s (still at or under the set speed); 1 and 3.5 m/s over: near identical. Minimum gap and TTC no worse except 305 40.8
  (54.2 -> 52.0 m at 54 m). Worst case 2f2 871.2: about 0.2 m/s more speed into a lead at 60-80 m, brake -0.45 -> -0.59. Real
  lift-offs in these logs (26b 9:16/9:39, 2a6 1:47) are identical (large overshoots already at the full floor).
- **Lever if a driver reports carrying too much speed after a gas press:** `GAS_OVERRIDE_COAST` off, or a deeper in-window floor.

## D-096 — The far railed-lead camera bound also covers near-rail readings and leads from 50 m (STATUS 232, 2026-10-10, replay only, not driven)

- **Finding (route 00000312, owner: "see if radar is exhibiting the same bug").** Newly adopted Bosch-A tracks published vRel
  held flat at -12.0 or -11.1 (raw 65, 0.9 m/s off the rail) for 0.6-1.7 s while their own range was flat or opening and the
  camera saw a steady car at the same range. FAR_RAIL_VISION_BOUND (298 BM3) missed them: it needed the exact rail and >= 80 m.
- **Shipped default on (owner: "Yeah let's try all 3").** In `far_rail_vrel_floor`: (1) "railed" is now within
  `FAR_RAIL_NEAR_RAIL_MARGIN_MPS` = 1.0 of the low rail (the ONPATH_ADOPT_RAIL_VREL_MARGIN_MPS precedent; replaces
  FAR_RAIL_VREL_TOL_MPS 0.05); (2) `FAR_RAIL_MIN_D_REL_M` 80 -> 50 m; (3) unchanged: the range veto (vRelRangeDerived closing at
  least as fast as the floor keeps the rail) and the NEWBORN young_range_genuinely_closing exemption. Camera match rules,
  margin (3.0 m/s) and the fact that nothing is deleted or coasted (D-041/D-042) are unchanged.
- **Evidence (closed-loop replay, acl.py, base = old 80 m / exact rail).** 312 807.9 (log 813.6-814.0, track 62 back from a
  +12 m range excursion onto the camera's 54 m car at -12.0): sim accel min -2.71 -> -2.43, plan -1.79 -> -0.59 at 813.98.
  312 1405.8 (log 1412.2-1413.0, track 23 at 82-87 m opening at -11.1): sim accel -2.84 -> -1.95, plan -1.97 -> -0.20.
  13 protected windows frame-identical (311 2490.0 hard real brake with a railed radar, 298 BM3, 297 4656, 2a6, 2f2 x4,
  305, 308 x4); 312 609 frames identical.
- **Not covered.** 312 609.8 (railed track 28 at 63 m; camera car 10-15 m farther, so no range match) and 312 1342.3 (held
  -7.9, not near the rail). A wider camera range tolerance or a held-value rule would be a new decision.
- **Lever:** `FAR_RAIL_NEAR_RAIL_MARGIN_MPS` 0.05 and `FAR_RAIL_MIN_D_REL_M` 80 restore the previous behaviour exactly.

## D-097 — Gas comes back gently after a coast (STATUS 233, 2026-10-10, log analysis + static only, not driven)

**Problem (owner, 2026-10-10):** the coast-gas cycle gives the driver nausea; the gas resume after a coast feels too strong.

**Evidence:** sendcan ACC_CONTROL over route 00000308 (6 segments) and 00000312 (5 segments): 32 coast -> gas handoffs.
In 8 of them the gas went from -30000 to the road-load amount (116-243 units) in 0.1-0.6 s, because the only limit was
the 60 units/frame (3000 units/s) one. 308 5:26.7 at 26 m/s: 0 -> 116 in 0.2 s, aEgo -0.38 -> -0.10. In the other 24 the
gas already rose slower than 100 units/s, following the planner target; there the swing is the planner's own catch-up
after a coast that ran deeper (-0.3..-0.4) than the plan's easing target (-0.05..-0.10).

**Decision:** `BOSCH_RESUME_GAS_RAMP` (carcontroller, default ON). After a coast frame (longActive, gas off, no brake
request) the gas rises from 0 at 100 units/s (~0.13 m/s^2 of force per s), faster for larger targets up to 600 units/s at
0.8 m/s^2. It ends once it reaches the requested gas, on any brake frame, and when long is not active. It only lowers
gas; brake selection and all negative targets are unchanged. The gas learner is held while it ramps. On the 8 sharp
handoffs, 90% gas is now reached in 1.3-2.9 s instead of 0.1-0.6 s.

**Not addressed:** the planner catch-up swing (the other 24). Reducing that means coasting less, or only when the
target is close to the coast level (D-092 entry); left for the owner to choose.

## D-098 — The speed-up after a coast rises gently (STATUS 234, 2026-10-10, replay + static only, not driven)

**Problem (owner, 2026-10-10):** the coast-gas cycle still gives nausea. After D-097 handles the gas jump at the
moment a coast ends, the rest is the planner's catch-up: the coast slows the car at its fixed rate (-0.2..-0.4), deeper
than the plan's easing target (-0.05..-0.10), so the planner asks for the lost speed back (24 of 32 handoffs on 308+312).

**Rejected:** removing the coasts (smooth pedal, one pedal everywhere). Closed-loop replay of 17 min on 8 routes cut the
cycles 18 -> 13 but the over-slowing is also the margin to the lead: 2f2 777.6 s gap/follow 0.95 -> 0.56..0.89, 312b
806.3 s brake -1.30 -> -1.82..-2.73. Coasting only near the coast level (coast time 9.4 -> 4.9 %) raised the swing p99.

**Decision:** `COAST_RESUME_CAP` (planner, default ON). While a D-091/D-092 coast is published the cap is 0; after it,
a positive target may only rise at `COAST_RESUME_JERK` 0.1 m/s^3 until the cap passes 0.6 m/s^2. Only positive targets
are lowered; braking is never limited. Same replay, 41 coast ends, rate sweep 0.1/0.2/0.4: 0.1 cut the 4 s peak p90
+0.51 -> +0.40 and the median time to +0.15 from 1.1 to 1.6 s, min gap/follow 0.46 -> 0.50, mean speed -0.07 m/s;
0.2 and 0.4 matched no cap. The replay does not model the D-097 gas ramp, so the two together are untested.
