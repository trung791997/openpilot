# Measured on 00000232--fc8dad0d18 (device commit 0083ffa, replayed through this parser):

# was published exactly 0 times. Its last published geometry was dRel 38.9 m, yRel -0.1 m: the lead
# we were following. The device's own recording agrees -- liveTracks carries id 37 in 894/894 frames
# of segment 8 and 569/893 of segment 9, then 0 in segments 10-12, and the radar lead goes from
# 1200/1200 frames to 0/1200 across that boundary. Track 34 did the same at an age of 137.5 s.
#

# This was briefly treated as "no measurement" and routed to the coast path. That was a safety

# rail with healthy u10 (78-94), range closing smoothly at -19.4 m/s. The radar lead was dropped,
# radard fell back to the vision lead which reported only -11.4 m/s, and the planner commanded 0.00
# while closing on stopped traffic at 76 m with a 6.6 s TTC. The driver had to intervene.
#

# have that power.
#
# Scope, measured on Peter's nine flagged events: this catches GROSS disagreement -- the 000001eb
# 6:59 event reported vRel -10.58 m/s while the range was actually opening at +0.46 m/s, an 11 m/s
# contradiction, across a track-identity change. It deliberately does NOT try to catch the milder
# 0.6-2.5 m/s overshoots seen at deceleration onset: a trailing window legitimately lags
# instantaneous velocity during real braking, so a threshold tight enough to catch those would also
# reject genuine hard decels. Those are the u10 gate's job.
#
# The test is ONE-SIDED, and that matters. U11 lags the true closure at a deceleration onset -- at
# 000001f3 19:27 the fitted range rate was -6.7 m/s while U11 still read -2.08 -- so a symmetric
# |U11 - rate| test fires during genuine hard braking and coasts exactly when the velocity is most
# needed. Lag can only make U11 UNDER-report closing while the lead is braking, so only the other
# direction is evidence of a fault: U11 claiming more closing than the geometry can support.
# Checked both ways: 000001eb 6:59 (U11 -10.58 while the range OPENED at +0.46) is rejected;
# the 000001f3 onset is not. In the mirror case, a lead accelerating away, the one-sided test
# coasts a more-conservative velocity, so it fails safe.
