"""Honda VSA yaw rate (0x94 KINEMATICS YAW_RATE) with each car's zero learned at standstill.

The DBC decodes against the nominal zero, 512 counts, but every unit sits a few counts off it (2018 Clarity 508,
2019 Civic Bosch 513) and holds that offset exactly at every stop. With the wheels stopped the true yaw rate is
zero, so the average reading there is the zero. The scale is not learnable that way and is measured per model
against GPS heading, using only stretches that start and end driving straight (there the ~0.4 s lag of the 1 Hz
GPS bearing and the car's sideslip cancel; fits over arbitrary windows are biased by both).

The Clarity's sensor also under-reads clockwise (right) turns by ~0.24 deg/s from about 1 deg/s up, while left
turns and small rates read true (mechanism unknown). Measured on GPS windows where the yaw rate is steady at
both ends: straights +0.007 +/- 0.004, right 0.75-1.5 deg/s +0.17..0.18, right 1.5-2.5 deg/s +0.21..0.23
(at 0.25/count; ~0.02 more at 0.246), left 0.75-2.5 deg/s +0.03..0.06, which the scale below accounts for.
It ramps in across +3..+5 counts.

Clarity scale 0.246 (not 0.25): 12 whole turns, straight before and after, 0.2456-0.2470; 1670 straight-to-
straight GPS pairs on 9 routes, 0.2468 +/- 0.0008 with the clockwise correction (every route 0.244-0.250). Left
and right turns agree only with the correction (without it, 0.2514 right vs 0.2447 left). On those pairs the
heading error falls from 1.81 deg rms (0.25, no correction) to ~0.9 deg.
