"""Honda VSA yaw rate (0x94 KINEMATICS YAW_RATE) with each car's zero learned at standstill.

The DBC decodes against the nominal zero, 512 counts, but every unit sits a few counts off it (2018 Clarity 508,
2019 Civic Bosch 513) and holds that offset exactly at every stop. With the wheels stopped the true yaw rate is
zero, so the average reading there is the zero. The scale is not learnable that way and is measured per model
against GPS heading.
