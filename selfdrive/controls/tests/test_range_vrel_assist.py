"""Tests for the range-derived vRel assist (D-053 rework, TEST feature, default OFF).

The assist lets the range-LSQ closing rate correct the Bosch-A native U11 velocity, in ONE
direction only: it may report more closing, never less. Read the RANGE_VREL_ASSIST_* comment
blocks in radard.py before changing a number here -- every constant carries the evidence that set
it, and several of these tests exist only to make a specific failure mode visible.

The rework adds a ~1 s long fit that must AGREE with the short fit before arming, clear-only guards
(long-fit residual, span, ego-speed floor, backward-lead plausibility, rail rule, zero-speed cap),
and keeps the lead Kalman filter on native U11 so aLeadK never sees the correction. Every guard
has a negative control next to it that breaks the guard and proves the test notices (D-009).

The tests that matter most are the negative ones. This feature reads the range channel to check a
velocity channel, so it is BLIND to a range error. `TestTheRangeWalkFault`, `TestRecorded232Walk`
and `TestRecorded236Settle` pin that the recorded range faults leave the assist inert. If a future
change makes one of those fire, this feature has become a brake-harder amplifier for a fault the
branch has actually recorded.

Geometry and velocities are taken from recorded routes wherever a recorded number exists, so a
change that breaks one of these breaks against road data rather than an invented scenario (D-009).
Nothing here is road evidence FOR the assist: these are static unit tests against synthetic range
series, and the reworked assist has only been replayed open-loop, never run on a car.
