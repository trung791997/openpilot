"""nrdr: the modified-EPS lateral controller built on the EPS firmware's own control law (Clarity and Civic Bosch C020).

Ported from JamesL787/openpilot vfn-controller-shadow (shadow 52618f42, controller 8c3a3fd8, output LPF fd815ef3).
The feedforward and HondaEpsLateralCore below are upstream's, line for line, with the firmware constants moved
into a calibration and the fixed P/I trims into arguments, so the Civic Bosch C020 image can use its own. The
feedforward is logged in shadow by LatControlPID; NrdrLatEpsFirmwareFF hands the car to LatControlHondaEps,
which runs HondaEpsLateralCore exactly as upstream does on the Clarity (STATUS 164-166).

The Clarity's LKAS path is not a torque command. The firmware turns our 0xE4 value into a target R5,
compares it with R6 -- a filtered steering RATE (R6 = -138.6 counts per deg/s, corr 0.98 against
steeringRateDeg) -- and runs P + D + KFF on the difference at 1 kHz. So every command first has to cancel
the firmware's own rate damping (Kp * 138.6 / 1024 = 16..36 counts per deg/s, 2-5x the rack's physical
damping), which is why vfn's angle PID trails a turn-in by ~250 ms x steering rate below 25 mph. On a turn
exit that same damping is the braking that holds the line -- which is why the symmetric rate feedforward
of 709dbba828 cut exits and was reverted.

This inverts the chain instead. A column load model (stiffness, speed stiffness, viscous, Coulomb friction,
road roll) says what motor output a motion needs; the firmware law is solved for the R5 that produces it,
rate damping included; the command map is inverted back to a lateral output. On a turn-in the load and
damping terms add, on an exit they cancel, so no hand-tuned asymmetry is needed.

Evidence, routes 00000352 / 00000353 (vfn 35ddc44b, P-minus-5 firmware):
  - E4 = -3840 * u; R5 = 7.7 * E4 ~20 ms later (corr 0.998); firmware output reproduced to 1-2 counts
    (corr 0.999) by the law in firmware_output() below.
  - Load model fitted on 352. On the held-out 353, the target this computes from the desired angle alone
    matches the R5 the car actually ran with R^2 0.79 on turning frames (|angle| > 2 deg; 0.75 below
    25 mph, 0.86 above) and explains 46% of vfn's command over all engaged frames. The kf * angle * v^2
    feedforward it replaces explains 5% or less on either measure.

Firmware constants are for ONE build: Clarity_Pminus5_P117to265_D737_KFF45_NoR6L2_Tracker3200_Norm1650
(rwd-xray-2026chatgpt/CLARITY_PMINUS5_TRACKER3200_NORM1650_20260728). The version string does not
identify the build, so re-check these after any reflash. CIVIC_BOSCH_C020 below is the owner's image, see
its own comment and STATUS 163.

# At speed the feedforward also applies near straight (weight 1 from 8 m/s). An opt-in 10-30 deg gate above the
# crawl band (NrdrLatEpsFfAngleGate) was tried against the PR 10 sim verdict's highway wiggle (sha1 15223963: F2
# wig ratio, unitless 0.6-2 Hz wheel/desired, 0.84 -> 1.26 hands off at 45 mph and 0.91-1.21 -> 1.63-2.03 on the
# route-296 replays) and removed 2026-09-30 (owner's call). In the P' sim rounds (R2-R4) it was no smoother than
# without it, and its step fails against the pre-PR 10 controller were not shown to come from the gate. On the
# road (limited road evidence, steeringRateDeg, hands off, |dcurv| < 0.0005, 22.4-25 m/s only; 16-25 m/s reads
# 1.31 vs 1.00) route 298 without it read 1.10 deg/s against 0.63 on 297 (pre-PR 10), but 299 with it read 1.33
# with the feedforward at weight 0 on every straight frame, so that gap was road spread. The key stays in
# params_keys.h and is not read.
# Open question (sim only, 5-8 m/s): with the old 10-30 gate at every speed, the closed-loop sim took the 5-8 /
# 8-12 m/s wobble on route 286 from 1.03 / 0.67 to 0.27 / 0.23 (29698ea5a). Here the feedforward keeps some
# weight near straight in that band (0.62 in the P' R4 sim), and that sim read rough 0.032 vs 0.015 against the
# pre-PR 10 controller (5.0-5.7 m/s only, content not matched). Not yet checked on the road.
