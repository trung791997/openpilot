"""nrdr: the modified-EPS lateral controller built on the EPS firmware's own control law (Clarity and Civic Bosch C020).

Ported from JamesL787/openpilot vfn-controller-shadow (shadow 52618f42, controller 8c3a3fd8, output LPF fd815ef3).
The feedforward and ClarityEpsLateralCore below are upstream's, line for line, with the firmware constants moved
into a calibration and the fixed P/I trims into arguments, so the Civic Bosch C020 image can use its own. The
feedforward is logged in shadow by LatControlPID; NrdrLatEpsFirmwareFF hands the car to LatControlClarityEps,
which runs ClarityEpsLateralCore exactly as upstream does on the Clarity (STATUS 164-166).

The Clarity's LKAS path is not a torque command. The firmware turns our 0xE4 value into a target R5,
compares it with R6 -- a filtered steering RATE (R6 = -138.6 counts per deg/s, corr 0.98 against
steeringRateDeg) -- and runs P + D + KFF on the difference at 1 kHz. So every command first has to cancel
the firmware's own rate damping (Kp * 138.6 / 1024 = 16..36 counts per deg/s, 2-5x the rack's physical
damping), which is why vfn's angle PID trails a turn-in by ~250 ms x steering rate below 25 mph. On a turn
exit that same damping is the braking that holds the line -- which is why the symmetric rate feedforward
of 709dbba828 cut exits and was reverted.

This inverts the chain instead. A column load model (stiffness, speed stiffness, viscous, Coulomb friction,
road roll) says what motor output a motion needs; the firmware law is solved for the R5 that produces it,
rate damping included; the command map is inverted back to a lateral output. On a turn-in the load and
damping terms add, on an exit they cancel, so no hand-tuned asymmetry is needed.

Evidence, routes 00000352 / 00000353 (vfn 35ddc44b, P-minus-5 firmware):
  - E4 = -3840 * u; R5 = 7.7 * E4 ~20 ms later (corr 0.998); firmware output reproduced to 1-2 counts
    (corr 0.999) by the law in firmware_output() below.
  - Load model fitted on 352. On the held-out 353, the target this computes from the desired angle alone
    matches the R5 the car actually ran with R^2 0.79 on turning frames (|angle| > 2 deg; 0.75 below
    25 mph, 0.86 above) and explains 46% of vfn's command over all engaged frames. The kf * angle * v^2
    feedforward it replaces explains 5% or less on either measure.

Firmware constants are for ONE build: Clarity_Pminus5_P117to265_D737_KFF45_NoR6L2_Tracker3200_Norm1650
(rwd-xray-2026chatgpt/CLARITY_PMINUS5_TRACKER3200_NORM1650_20260728). The version string does not
identify the build, so re-check these after any reflash. CIVIC_BOSCH_C020 below is the owner's image, see
its own comment and STATUS 163.
