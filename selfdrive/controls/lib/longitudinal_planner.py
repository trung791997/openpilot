# path corrected vRel, the output sat at the -1.0 comfort floor from -3.19 to -2.79 s before
# the bookmark. A per-line trace shows what held it: the close-lead brake cap asked about -2.3
# but is built against the comfort floor (`get_close_lead_brake_cap(..., output_accel_min)`),
# while the MPC itself was still ramping from its cruise-to-lead source switch (-0.13 ... -0.97)
# and so was above -1.0 the whole time; the persistence pass above never had anything to pass.
# Opening the floor for every closing lead (STATUS 120 F2/F2L) added ~39 new hard brakes, so
# the cap may pass the comfort floor only for a lead that is closing fast, is short on time, is
# the lead the MPC is braking for, and that vision sees closing too:
#   radar lead, -vRel >= FAST_CLOSING_LEAD_MIN_CLOSING, dRel / -vRel <= FAST_CLOSING_LEAD_MAX_TTC,

#   x within FAST_CLOSING_LEAD_VISION_MATCH of dRel) closes at >= FAST_CLOSING_LEAD_MIN_VISION_CLOSING.
# The vision test is what keeps a U11 rail phantom (-13.5 m/s published on a flat range, 276
# 13:46.6) out: vision sees no closing there. Replayed without it (28 routes) the pass made 4 more

# 7 s moved 2 more brakes earlier and deepened 3 more, with the same new crossings. The floor
# then opens to the cap's own value, not to the vehicle minimum. Once fired it stays for the same track while it still closes at
# >= FAST_CLOSING_LEAD_HOLD_CLOSING, so the brake does not snap back to -1.0 as soon as the
# closing speed dips under the entry value. A first version held while the lead was closing at

    It is the larger of two scenarios, and neither is a guarantee: `match` assumes the lead holds
    its current speed, `stop` assumes the lead decelerates at exactly the current aLeadK until it
    stops. It therefore understates a lead that brakes harder later and overstates one that stops
    braking, and it inherits aLeadK's staleness (~0.5-0.7 s on this platform) and noise -- the
    0.1 m/s^2 branch threshold is below aLeadK's own noise, so `stop` can arm on noise alone.
    Read it as "roughly what this geometry implies", never as a control reference.

    The denominator is the PHYSICAL standoff, not the follow distance. An earlier version used
    `dRel - (t_follow*v_ego + standoff)` floored at 0.5 m, which treats a comfort target as a
    barrier: inside the follow distance -- the normal case -- the gap clamped to the floor and
    closing^2/(2*gap) exploded. It logged 40.62 m/s^2 on 00000206 at the very event it was added to
    explain, and reached 21.01 with 0.79% of frames over 10 m/s^2 on 000001fb. Re-derived against
    the standoff it never exceeds 4.64 m/s^2 over 7500 frames on those two routes, and during real
    braking on 00000206 commanded/required has a median of 1.02.

    Two terms, whichever is larger, and zero when neither applies:
      match: null the closing rate before contact        closing^2 / 2d
      stop:  both come to rest, if the lead is braking    v_ego^2 / 2*(d + lead stopping distance)
