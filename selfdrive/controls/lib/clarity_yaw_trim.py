"""Honda Clarity / Civic Bosch (modified EPS) curvature delivery trim, learned from the car's own yaw sensor (0x94). Only numpy here, so
offline tools can replay exactly this code.

The rack map (clarity_rack_map) and the controller put the car on the requested curvature to within a few
percent, but what is left (tyres, load, temperature, rack wear, a map fitted on one car) is a steady ratio
between the curvature commanded and the curvature the car turns. The VSA yaw rate measures that directly:
car curvature = yaw rate / speed, ~17 ms behind the wheels and GPS-verified. This estimates that ratio per
speed and scales the requested curvature by its inverse.

Left and right are estimated separately and the correction uses their mean, so an additive bias (an angle
offset) cancels while a ratio does not. The left/right split this was built for (lefts 5-12% hot, rights 2-6%
cold from 9 m/s up) turned out to be the yaw sensor's clockwise under-read, fixed in the decode; since the
rack map refit on the corrected decode, both sides land within ~1% below 16 m/s and 1-5% above on held-out
routes, so this is a small safety net.
On the Civic Bosch there is no rack map; its steering ratio curve is the only curvature model, so this is the
whole ratio correction there. Replayed open-loop on Civic routes 299/29b/29c/29d it settles at 0.98-1.00 on three
and 0.93-0.95 at 10-15 m/s on 299 (right turns turning 7-13% more than commanded); the lags below are the
Clarity's and only line up the steady windows.
The ratio is estimated against what was commanded (requested x the applied gain), so it is a plant estimate
that the correction does not feed back into.

It is deliberately slow and only learns from steady turning:
- The requested curvature must have held within 10% for the delivery lag plus 0.25 s, and the car's within
  15% for 0.25 s. A turn-in or exit is lag, not a ratio, and must not be learned as one.
- The curvature must be at least 0.0015 1/m, so an angle offset is not mistaken for a ratio, and at least
  0.5 m/s^2 of lateral acceleration, so the 0.25 deg/s yaw count is not the error.
- Nothing is learned while the driver steers, for a second after, on hard acceleration or braking, below
  4 m/s, or from a reading more than 30% off (a sensor fault or a skid, not a ratio).
- Each estimate closes an error over TAU_S of learning time, and the correction is held within +/-8%.
Near straight the requested curvature is ~0, so the trim does nothing there and cannot steer a straight road.
