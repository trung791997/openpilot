# --- Range-derived vRel assist (TEST, default OFF, param RangeDerivedVrel) --------------------
# D-053 amends D-044's "nothing consumes it" for Bosch-A only, behind a toggle. ONE-SIDED: the
# range LSQ above may only make the published closing speed MORE closing, never less. It exists
# because U11 -- the Bosch-A native relative velocity -- is both late and rail-bounded, and both
# failures understate closing:
#
#   * D-041, route 000001f9 at 29:52. U11 railed at -13.5 m/s on 88 of 88 active frames with
#     healthy u10 while the range closed smoothly at -19.4 m/s. D-041 publishes the rail as a
#     BOUND and says recovering the true value past it "needs the range channel and is
#     deliberately left to a separate, validated change". This is that change, still unvalidated.
#   * D-043 / D-044, routes 000001fe/fb/fd. U11 detects a closing onset 0.88-1.28 s late while a
#     4-sample range LSQ lands within 0.07-0.14 s. At 000001f3 19:27 the fitted range rate was
#     -6.7 m/s while U11 still read -2.08.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT DO, and it is the hazard, not a caveat: the LSQ is fitted to the same range
# channel U11 is being checked against, so a RANGE error is invisible to it. STATUS.md's t~=11 s
# false brake is exactly that -- U11 (-6.0) and the fitted rate (-4.5 to -6.4) agreed with each
# other while the range itself walked ~6 m inward. On those recorded figures the disagreement
# never reaches MIN_DISAGREEMENT and this assist stays inert, but a range walk that outran U11
# would be amplified by it, bounded only by MAX_CORRECTION and the guards in the rework block below.
#
# 2026-09-16 REWORK. The first version was replayed open-loop, with the real Track, over every
# liveTracks sweep of three routes: 00000232, 00000236 and 00000237. It did recover what it was
# built for (236 12:51, a nearly stopped car behind a -13.5 rail), but it also corrected three
# times with no closing to recover, and its KF step did harm in a fourth case:
#   * 232 3:02.8, a range WALK. Range 59.0 -> 56.1 -> 59.1 m over ~2.6 s while U11 read +2.1 ->
#     +0.1 -> +1.1; the 5-sample fit followed the walk and armed at 4.3-4.6 m/s.
#   * 236 22:13.6, a NEW TRACK settling. Range 77.2 -> 59.5 m in 1.8 s then flat: a +10 m/s^2
#     relative acceleration no car does. Correction hit the 8.0 cap.
#   * 236 14:45, EGO STOPPED. vEgo 0.0, U11 +1.5..+2.3, 5-sample fit -9 to -12.7. Cap again.
#   * Feeding the corrected speed to the lead KF made aLeadK absorb every arming step as an
#     acceleration: worst extra aLeadK dip -3.8 / -7.2 / -6.0 m/s^2 on the three routes, and
#     long_mpc and conditional_chill_mode read aLeadK directly. At 236 18:55 the vRel correction
#     itself matched the range; that dip was the harm.
# The rework keeps the short fit (and the vRelRangeDerived telemetry) byte-identical, adds a
# second, longer fit that must AGREE before anything is published, and adds guards that each
# CLEAR the correction outright. The only clamps are MAX_CORRECTION and the zero-speed cap, and
# both are physical bounds rather than tuned values. The lead KF is fed the NATIVE speed again;
# the correction is applied at publish time only, so aLeadK never sees it. Still replay-only:
# nothing here has been driven.

# Minimum disagreement, m/s, before arming. D-043 deliberately does not chase "the milder
# 0.6-2.5 m/s overshoots at deceleration onset"; this is the mirror of that, and 2.0 m/s is also
# the band tools/bosch_a_vrel_shadow_report.py already reports against. It is NOT a noise floor on
# its own: with 5 evenly spaced samples the LSQ slope moves 0.2/h per metre of error on the newest
# sample, h = 1/14.35 s, so a single 1 m range outlier shifts the fit ~2.9 m/s and clears this on
# its own. ARM_UPDATES is what rejects that, not this threshold.
RANGE_VREL_ASSIST_MIN_DISAGREEMENT_MPS = 2.0

# Consecutive measured updates above that threshold before any correction is applied. One gross
# range outlier cannot arm this: as it walks the 5-sample window its leverage on the fit runs
# +2h, +h, 0, -h, -2h (normalised by sum (t - tbar)^2 = 10h^2), so it can only push the fit the
# SAME way for two consecutive fits. Three would therefore be sufficient; five is taken instead to
# match ONSET_SUSTAIN_SAMPLES in tools/bosch_a_vrel_shadow_report.py, so the offline onset report
# the driver runs to judge this feature uses the same rule the car does. Cost 5/14.35 = 0.35 s

# range -6.7). This is n = 2 and NOT a distribution -- it is a bound on the damage a bad fit can

# --- Rework guards (2026-09-16). Chosen on the three-route replay above, which is OPEN-LOOP: a
# corrected lead changes what the car does next, and none of that is in these numbers. Every value
# below keeps all three recorded false corrections at exactly zero -- n = 3 known hurts, not a
# distribution. Replay figures are m/s*s (the correction integrated over the case). "Help" is the
# five recorded under-reads the rework still corrects -- 236 12:51 and 18:55, 237 5:21, 14:25 and
# 19:49 -- which total 42.7 m/s*s with every constant at the value below.
#
# The LONG fit. The same plain LSQ over the last 15 measured range samples (~1.0 s at 14.35 Hz), in
# its own deque that every measured update appends to, lead or not, and that is never cleared: a
# history that spans a gap is rejected by span instead. The disagreement acted on is the SMALLER of
# the short and long ones, so both fits must see the extra closing. With h = 1/14.35 s:
#   * a persistent range STEP of s metres moves four consecutive 5-sample fits by 2.87s, 4.30s,
#     4.30s and 2.87s m/s, so a 0.7 m step alone holds MIN_DISAGREEMENT for four fits, one short of
#     ARM_UPDATES. The 15-sample fit moves at most 1.43s, so there the step has to be 1.4 m.
#   * the price is lag: the long slope is the rate ~0.49 s ago. It under-reads a growing closing
#     rate (the one-sided rule turns that into a later, smaller correction, never a wrong-way one)
#     and over-reads a shrinking one, which the min() with the short fit bounds.
#   * a single gross outlier of e metres moves it by at most e/(40h) = 0.36e m/s and leaves an RMS
#     residual of 0.22-0.25e, so an outlier big enough to push it 2 m/s (5.6 m) fails the residual.
#   * a track cannot correct until it has 15 measured samples. On the replay that requirement,
#     not the speed floor, is what zeroed 236 14:45: it was a new track, and it stayed at zero with
#     the speed floor, the residual and the plausibility guards all removed.
# Replayed alternatives: 10 samples (span floor 0.4 s) let the walk (1.8 m/s*s) and the settle (1.3)
# back through; 20 kept every hurt at zero but corrected 29% less (30.4 m/s*s of help, not 42.7).

# braking event; it rejects range behaviour no car produces. The 236 22:13.6 settle ran 1.17 ->
